description: This workflow processes a collection of genome assemblies to identify and align orthologous protein sequences using Funannotate for annotation, ProteinOrtho for orthogroup detection, and ClustalW for multiple sequence alignment. Use this skill when you need to prepare high-quality, aligned orthologous datasets from raw genomic assemblies for downstream phylogenetic tree reconstruction and evolutionary analysis.

# preparing-genomic-data-for-phylogeny-recostruction-gtn

## Overview

This workflow automates the preparation of genomic data for phylogenetic analysis, starting from a collection of genome assemblies from different samples, strains, or species. It handles initial preprocessing steps, including header cleaning and repeat masking via [RepeatMasker](https://www.repeatmasker.org/), to ensure the assemblies are optimized for downstream annotation.

The core of the pipeline involves structural annotation using [Funannotate](https://github.com/nextgenusfs/funannotate) to predict proteins, followed by quality assessment and further annotation with [BUSCO](https://busco.ezlab.org/). It then utilizes [ProteinOrtho](https://www.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de/Software/proteinortho/) to identify orthologous groups across the input samples, filtering the results to extract only those orthogroups where every sample is represented.

In the final stages, the workflow extracts the sequences for these universal orthologs and performs multiple sequence alignment using [ClustalW](http://www.clustal.org/clustal2/). The resulting alignments provide the necessary foundation for reconstructing evolutionary relationships.

## Inputs and data preparation

| Step | Label | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Input genomes as collection | data_collection_input |  |


Upload your genome assemblies in FASTA format and organize them into a single list collection to ensure the workflow correctly iterates through each sample during the annotation and orthology stages. It is important to verify that your sequence headers are concise and unique to avoid issues during the protein extraction and alignment steps. For comprehensive instructions on preparing your specific datasets, refer to the `README.md` file. You can also use `planemo workflow_job_init` to generate a `job.yml` template for configuring your workflow runs.

## How to run (Planemo)

### Local Galaxy (default engine)

```bash
planemo run Galaxy-Workflow-preparing_genomic_data_for_phylogeny_recostruction_(GTN)(1).ga job.yml --download_outputs --output_directory . --output_json output.json
```

Optional: `--galaxy_root /path/to/galaxy` speeds up spinning up a local Galaxy.

### Docker Galaxy

Append e.g. `--engine docker_galaxy --ignore_dependency_problems` (requires Docker).

### External Galaxy (usegalaxy.org / EU / …)

```bash
planemo run Galaxy-Workflow-preparing_genomic_data_for_phylogeny_recostruction_(GTN)(1).ga job.yml --engine external_galaxy --galaxy_url SERVER_URL --galaxy_user_key YOUR_API_KEY
```

Create a reusable profile: `planemo profile_create myprofile --galaxy_url ... --galaxy_user_key ... --engine external_galaxy` then `planemo run Galaxy-Workflow-preparing_genomic_data_for_phylogeny_recostruction_(GTN)(1).ga job.yml --profile myprofile`.

### Job file

- Generate a template: `planemo workflow_job_init Galaxy-Workflow-preparing_genomic_data_for_phylogeny_recostruction_(GTN)(1).ga -o job.yml`
- Lint: `planemo workflow_lint Galaxy-Workflow-preparing_genomic_data_for_phylogeny_recostruction_(GTN)(1).ga`

See **[Running Galaxy workflows](https://planemo.readthedocs.io/en/master/running.html)** in the Planemo documentation.

## Invocation outputs

After a successful run with `--download_outputs`, files appear under your chosen `--output_directory`. `--output_json` records CWL-style metadata for outputs (paths, checksums).

On an external Galaxy, use `planemo invocation_download INVOCATION_ID --profile ...` to fetch outputs, or track progress with `planemo workflow_track INVOCATION_ID`.

Workflow steps marked as **workflow outputs** in the editor are listed under **Workflow outputs**; exact filenames depend on tools and Galaxy configuration.
