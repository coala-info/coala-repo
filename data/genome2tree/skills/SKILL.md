# genome2tree

## Overview
The `genome2tree` pipeline is a specialized tool for bacterial phylogenomics. It automates the "supermatrix approach" by identifying orthologous single-copy genes shared across a set of genomes. The pipeline integrates several bioinformatics tools—OrthoFinder for ortholog detection, MAFFT for alignment, ClipKIT for trimming, and PhyKIT for concatenation—into a single workflow. It is ideal for researchers who want to move from raw genomic sequences (.fasta, .fna, or .faa) to a concatenated alignment without manually managing intermediate file formats and tool-specific parameters.

## Installation and Environment
The tool is available via Bioconda. It is recommended to use a dedicated environment to avoid dependency conflicts.

```bash
conda create -n genome2tree_env python=3.10
conda activate genome2tree_env
conda install -c bioconda genome2tree
```

## Command Line Usage

### Basic Syntax
```bash
genome2tree.py -i <input_directory> -o <output_directory> [options]
```

### Common CLI Patterns

**1. Processing Protein Sequences (.faa)**
If your input files are already protein sequences, run the pipeline with default settings:
```bash
genome2tree.py -i ./protein_genomes/ -o ./phylogeny_results/ -t 8
```

**2. Processing DNA Sequences (.fna or .fasta)**
When starting with nucleotide sequences, you must use the `--dna` flag. The pipeline will automatically translate these into proteins using Prodigal before identifying orthologs:
```bash
genome2tree.py -i ./dna_genomes/ -o ./dna_results/ --dna -t 12
```

**3. Customizing Output and Rerunning**
Use a custom prefix for your final files and force a rerun of OrthoFinder if you have updated your input set:
```bash
genome2tree.py -i ./genomes/ -o ./results/ -p my_bacteria_tree --force -t 16
```

## Expert Tips and Best Practices

*   **Input Folder Hygiene**: Ensure the input directory contains *only* the genomic files (.fasta, .fna, .fa, or .faa). Extraneous files can cause errors during the OrthoFinder stage.
*   **Rooting the Tree**: `genome2tree` does not perform the final tree inference or rooting. To produce a rooted tree in downstream analysis, you must include an outgroup/reference genome in your initial input folder.
*   **Output Directory Management**: The pipeline cannot overwrite existing results in an output folder. It is best practice to specify a new directory path (e.g., `/path/to/output_v1/`); the script will create this folder automatically.
*   **Resource Allocation**: Ortholog detection is computationally intensive. For ~10 genomes, 8 threads typically take 10–20 minutes. For 100+ genomes, expect the process to take several hours and allocate threads accordingly.
*   **Downstream Analysis**: The primary output is `supermatrix.fa` (or `<prefix>.fa`). This file is a concatenated alignment of all identified single-copy orthologs. You should use this file as input for tree-building software:
    *   **IQ-TREE 2**: `iqtree2 -s supermatrix.fa -m AUTO -bb 1000`
    *   **RAxML-NG**: `raxml-ng --msa supermatrix.fa --model LG+G8+F --all`
