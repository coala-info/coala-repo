# phispy

## Overview
PhiSpy is a specialized tool designed to detect prophages—viral DNA integrated into bacterial chromosomes. It utilizes a Random Forest classifier trained on multiple metrics, including protein functional categories, DNA composition skews, and gene density. It is most effective when provided with high-quality genome annotations (such as those from RAST or Prokka) and can be customized to find specific mobile elements like plasmids or pathogenicity islands by adjusting gene density thresholds.

## Basic Usage
The primary command for the tool is `PhiSpy.py`.

### Standard Prediction
To run a basic search on an annotated GenBank file:
```bash
PhiSpy.py input_genome.gb -o output_directory
```

### Using a Training Set
For higher accuracy in specific species, use a pre-calculated training set:
```bash
PhiSpy.py input_genome.gb -o output_directory -t data/training_set.txt
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Detecting Other Mobile Elements
By default, PhiSpy is strict about identifying prophages. To identify other mobile genetic elements (plasmids, integrons, or pathogenicity islands), reduce the `--phage_genes` threshold:
- `--phage_genes 0`: Identifies all mobile elements (Note: this may also flag ribosomal RNA operons).
- `--phage_genes 5`: Increases stringency, reducing false positives but potentially missing smaller prophages.

### Visualization in Artemis
Use the `--color` flag to assign functional color codes to CDS features. This is highly useful for manual curation in the Artemis genome browser:
- **Red**: Integrase/Recombinase (likely insertion points).
- **Blue**: Other phage proteins.
- **Pink**: Mobile genetic elements.
- **Light Blue**: HMM database hits.

### Customizing Output Files
PhiSpy uses a bitmask system via the `--output_choice` parameter to determine which files are generated. Add the codes together to get your desired output:

| Code | File Type |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1 | `prophage_coordinates.tsv` (Coordinates and att sites) |
| 2 | `GenBank` format output (Input + prophage annotations) |
| 4 | Prophage and bacterial sequences (Fasta/GenBank) |
| 8 | `prophage_information.tsv` (Detailed gene-by-gene status) |
| 16 | `prophage.tsv` (Simple coordinates) |
| 32 | `GFF3` (Prophages only) |
| 128 | Random Forest test data |
| 256 | `GFF3` (Full annotated genomic contigs - recommended for Artemis) |

**Example**: To get the GenBank output (2) and the detailed information TSV (8), use `--output_choice 10`. The default is 3 (1 + 2).

## Expert Tips
- **Input Quality**: PhiSpy relies heavily on functional annotations. If your GenBank file lacks "product" or "function" tags, the accuracy will drop significantly. Re-annotate using Prokka or RAST if necessary.
- **Masking for Read Mapping**: Use output code 4 to generate a "masked" bacterial genome where prophage regions are replaced with 'N's. This is useful for mapping NGS reads to ensure they align to the host backbone rather than highly conserved viral regions.
- **Att Site Detection**: If `prophage_coordinates.tsv` contains attachment site data, check the "explanation" column to understand why those specific sites were chosen (e.g., based on repeats or proximity to tRNA).
