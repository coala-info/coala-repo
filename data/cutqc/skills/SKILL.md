# cutqc

## Overview
The `cutqc` tool is a Shell-based wrapper designed to simplify the preprocessing of FASTQ files. It automates the workflow of trimming adapters (via `cutadapt`) and assessing read quality (via `fastqc`), then uses RMarkdown and Plotly to generate a comprehensive visual report. This skill should be used when you need to process raw sequencing reads and require a consolidated view of quality metrics to verify the effectiveness of the trimming process.

## Command Line Usage

The tool is invoked via the `cutqc.sh` script and supports two primary subcommands: `cutqc` for paired-end processing and `qc_only` for single-file quality checks.

### Paired-End Trimming and QC
Use the `cutqc` subcommand to process paired-end reads. This performs trimming and runs FastQC on both the raw and trimmed data.

```bash
cutqc.sh cutqc <in_read1.fq.gz> <in_read2.fq.gz> <out_report.html> [cutadapt_options]
```

*   **Mandatory Arguments**: The first three arguments (Read 1, Read 2, and the output HTML filename) are positional and required.
*   **Passing Options**: Any arguments provided after the output HTML are passed directly to `cutadapt`. Use this to specify adapter sequences (e.g., `-a`, `-g`, `-A`, `-G`).

### Single-File Quality Control
Use the `qc_only` subcommand to generate a quality report for a single FASTQ file without performing trimming.

```bash
cutqc.sh qc_only <in_read.fq.gz> [output_report.html]
```

## Best Practices and Expert Tips

*   **Gzipped Inputs Only**: `cutqc` strictly requires gzipped input files (`.fq.gz` or `.fastq.gz`). Ensure files are compressed before running the tool.
*   **Avoid Output Flags**: When providing additional `cutadapt` options, **do not** include `-o` or `-p`. The `cutqc.sh` script manages output file paths internally; adding these flags will cause conflicts or errors.
*   **Interactive Reports**: The resulting HTML report uses Plotly, allowing you to zoom and hover over data points to inspect specific quality scores or sequence distributions.
*   **Conda Installation**: The most reliable way to ensure all dependencies (R, RMarkdown, Cutadapt, FastQC) are present is to install via Bioconda:
    ```bash
    conda install -c bioconda cutqc
    ```
