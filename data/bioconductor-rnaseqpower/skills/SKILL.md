# bioconductor-rnaseqpower

description: Statistical power and sample size calculations for RNA-Seq experiments. Use this skill when planning RNA-Seq studies to determine the required number of biological replicates, sequencing depth, or detectable effect size based on the negative binomial distribution model.

# bioconductor-rnaseqpower

## Overview

The `RNASeqPower` package provides a specialized tool for power analysis in high-throughput sequencing studies. It models the variance of RNA-Seq counts using a negative binomial distribution, accounting for both Poisson variation (sequencing depth) and biological variation (coefficient of variation between subjects). It is primarily used during the experimental design phase to balance the trade-offs between the number of samples, sequencing depth, and the biological effect size one wishes to detect.

## Core Functionality

The primary function in the package is `rnapower()`. It relates five key parameters:
1. **n**: Number of samples per group.
2. **cv**: Biological coefficient of variation (BCV).
3. **effect**: The relative expression (fold change) to detect (e.g., 1.5 for a 50% increase).
4. **alpha**: Type I error rate (false positive rate, typically 0.05).
5. **power**: Statistical power (1 - Type II error rate, typically 0.8 or 0.9).
6. **depth**: Expected count for a given transcript (sequencing depth).

### Basic Usage

To use the package, you must provide the `depth` and any four of the other five parameters. The function will solve for the missing parameter.

```r
library(RNASeqPower)

# Calculate required sample size (n) to detect a 2-fold change
# with 80% power, alpha 0.05, CV of 0.4, and depth of 20
rnapower(depth=20, cv=0.4, effect=2, alpha=0.05, power=0.8)

# Calculate power for a fixed sample size (n=10)
rnapower(depth=20, cv=0.4, effect=2, alpha=0.05, n=10)
```

## Workflows and Examples

### 1. Comparing Multiple Scenarios
You can pass vectors to parameters to generate a matrix of results, which is useful for visualizing trade-offs.

```r
# Compare sample sizes across different effect sizes and power targets
rnapower(depth=20, 
         cv=0.4, 
         effect=c(1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2), 
         alpha=0.05, 
         power=c(0.8, 0.9))
```

### 2. Unbalanced Designs
If groups have different sample sizes or different biological variability, use the `n2` and `cv2` arguments.

```r
# Group 1 has CV 0.3, Group 2 has CV 0.5
rnapower(depth=50, n=10, cv=0.3, cv2=0.5, effect=2, alpha=0.05)
```

### 3. Estimating Parameters
*   **Depth**: A total depth of 40 million reads often yields a coverage of $\ge 4$ for the majority of targets.
*   **CV**: Human studies typically show an average CV $\le 0.4$ for 90% of genes. Inbred animal models (like lab mice) often have a much lower CV, around 0.1.

## Tips for Interpretation

*   **Diminishing Returns of Depth**: Increasing sequencing depth (e.g., from 100 to 1000) often has a negligible effect on power compared to increasing the number of biological replicates (n) or reducing biological CV.
*   **CV Dominance**: In most RNA-Seq experiments, between-subject variability (CV) is the major component of error, not the assay/sequencing variation.
*   **Log-Scale Logic**: The power calculation is based on the variance of the log-counts: $Var(\log(y)) \approx 1/\mu + \psi^2$, where $\mu$ is depth and $\psi$ is CV.
