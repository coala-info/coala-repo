This document describes how to perform taxonomic classification of amino acid or nucleotide sequences with the
DECIPHER package using the IDTAXA algorithm. By definition, the taxonomy can be any scheme of classification:
organismal, functional, or operational. The IDTAXA algorithm is split into two phases: a “training” phase where
the classifier learns attributes of the training set, and a “testing” phase where sequences with unknown taxonomic
assignments are classified. The objective of sequence classification is to accurately assign a taxonomic label to as
many sequences as possible, while refraining from labeling sequences belonging to taxonomic groups that are not
represented in the training data. As a case study, the tutorial focuses on classifying a set of 16S ribosomal RNA
(rRNA) gene sequences using a training set of 16S rRNA sequences from organisms belonging to known taxonomic
groups. Despite the focus on the 16S rRNA gene, the IDTAXA process is the same for any set of sequences where
there exist a training set with known taxonomic assignments and a testing set with unknown taxonomic assignments.

2 Getting Started

2.1 Startup

To get started we need to load the DECIPHER package, which automatically loads a few other required packages.

> library(DECIPHER)

The classification process is split into two parts: training carried out by LearnTaxa and testing with IdTaxa. Help
for either function can be accessed through:

> ? IdTaxa

Once DECIPHER is installed, the code in this tutorial can be obtained via:

> browseVignettes("DECIPHER")

3 Training the Classifier

The training process only needs to occur once per training set, and results in an object that can be reused for testing
as many sequences as desired. If you already have the output of training the classifier (an object of class Taxa and
subclass Train), then you can skip to subsection 3.4 (Viewing the training data) below. Otherwise follow along with
this section to learn how to train the classifier.

The training process begins with a set of sequence representatives assigned to a taxonomic hierarchy, called
a “training set”. Typically taxonomic assignments are obtained from an authoritative source, but they can also be
automatically created (e.g., with Treeline). Here we describe the general training process, where the classifier
iteratively learns about the reference taxonomy.

Note that the training sequences should ideally span the full-length of the gene or target region. The test
(query) sequences can be partial length, but the training sequences are expected to overlap the same region as the
test sequences. Having excess training sequence beyond the region of the test sequence should not negatively effect
performance unless it is a very large amount of excess sequence (many-fold). Also, the training sequences should all
have complete taxonomy. That is, every training sequence should be classified to its terminal rank and not have an
incomplete classification.

3.1

Importing the training set

The first step is to set filepath to the sequences (in FASTA format) and the “taxid” file containing information about
taxonomic ranks. The “taxid” file is optional, but is often provided (along with training sequences) in a standard 5-
column, asterisks (“*”) delimited, text format used by many classifiers. To create your own “taxid” file, see 5 (Creating
a “taxid” file) below. Be sure to change the path names to those on your system by replacing all of the text inside quotes
labeled “<<path to ...>>” with the actual path on your system.

> # specify the path to your file of training sequences:
> seqs_path <- "<<path to training FASTA file>>"
> # read the sequences into memory
> seqs <- readDNAStringSet(seqs_path)
> # Alternatively use readAAStringSet or readRNAStringSet
>
> # (optionally) specify a path to the taxid file:
> rank_path <- "<<path to taxid text file>>"
> taxid <- read.table(rank_path,

2

header=FALSE,
col.names=c('Index', 'Name', 'Parent', 'Level', 'Rank'),
sep="*", # asterisks delimited
quote="", # preserve quotes
stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
> # OR, if no taxid text file exists, use:
> #taxid <- NULL

The training sequences cannot contain gap (“-” or “.”) characters, which can easily be removed with the RemoveGaps
function:

> # if they exist, remove any gaps in the sequences:
> seqs <- RemoveGaps(seqs)

Note that the training sequences must all be in the same orientation. If this is not the case, it is possible to reorient the
sequences with OrientNucleotides:

> # ensure that all sequences are in the same orientation:
> seqs <- OrientNucleotides(seqs)

Here, we make the assumption that each sequence is labeled in the original (FASTA) file by its taxonomy starting with
“Root;”. For example, a sequence might be labeled “AY193173 Root; Bacteria; SR1; SR1_genera_incertae_sedis”,
in which case we can extract all of the text starting from “Root;” to obtain the sequence’s “group”. In this context,
groups are defined as the set of all possible taxonomic labels that are present in the training set.

> # obtain the taxonomic assignments
> groups <- names(seqs) # sequence names
> # assume the taxonomy begins with 'Root;'
> groups <- gsub("(.*)(Root;)", "\\2", groups) # extract the group label
> groupCounts <- table(groups)
> u_groups <- names(groupCounts) # unique groups
> length(u_groups) # number of groups

3.2 Pruning the training set

The next step is to count the number of representatives per group and, optionally, select only a subset of sequences if the
group is deemed too large. Typically there is a diminishing return in accuracy for having more-and-more representative
sequences in a group. Limiting groups size may be advantageous if some groups contain an inordinately large number
of sequences because it will speed up the classification process. Also, larger groups oftentimes accumulate errors (that
is, sequences which do not belong), and constraining the group size can help to make the classification process more
robust to rare errors that may exist in the training data. In the code below, maxGroupSize controls the maximum size
of any group, and can be set to Inf (infinity) to allow for an unlimited number of sequences per group. An alternative
approach would be to use Clusterize to identify diverse sequences within each group.

> maxGroupSize <- 10 # max sequences per label (>= 1)
> remove <- logical(length(seqs))
> for (i in which(groupCounts > maxGroupSize)) {

index <- which(groups==u_groups[i])
keep <- sample(length(index),
maxGroupSize)
remove[index[-keep]] <- TRUE

}

> sum(remove) # number of sequences eliminated

3.3

Iteratively training the classifier

Now we must train the classifier on the training set. One unique feature of the IDTAXA algorithm is that during the
learning process it will identify any training sequences whose assigned classifications completely (with very high
confidence) disagree with their predicted classification. These are almost always sequences that are mislabeled in the
training data, and they can make the classification process slower and less accurate because they introduce error in the
training data. We have the option of automatically removing these putative “problem sequences” by iteratively repeat-
ing the training process. However, we may also want to be careful not to remove sequences that are the last remaining
representatives of an entire group in the training data, which can happen if the entire group appears to be misplaced in
the taxonomic tree. These two training options are controlled by the maxIterations and allowGroupRemoval variables
(below). Setting maxIterations to 1 will simply train the classifier without removing any problem sequences, whereas
values greater than 1 will iteratively remove problem sequences.

> maxIterations <- 3 # must be >= 1
> allowGroupRemoval <- FALSE
> probSeqsPrev <- integer() # suspected problem sequences from prior iteration
> for (i in seq_len(maxIterations)) {

cat("Training iteration: ", i, "\n", sep="")

# train the classifier
trainingSet <- LearnTaxa(seqs[!remove],

names(seqs)[!remove],
taxid)

# look for problem sequences
probSeqs <- trainingSet$problemSequences$Index
if (length(probSeqs)==0) {

cat("No problem sequences remaining.\n")
break

} else if (length(probSeqs)==length(probSeqsPrev) &&

all(probSeqsPrev==probSeqs)) {
cat("Iterations converged.\n")
break

}
if (i==maxIterations)
break

probSeqsPrev <- probSeqs

# remove any problem sequences
index <- which(!remove)[probSeqs]
remove[index] <- TRUE # remove all problem sequences
if (!allowGroupRemoval) {

# replace any removed groups
missing <- !(u_groups %in% groups[!remove])
missing <- u_groups[missing]
if (length(missing) > 0) {

index <- index[groups[index] %in% missing]
remove[index] <- FALSE # don't remove

}

}

}

> sum(remove) # total number of sequences eliminated

4

> length(probSeqs) # number of remaining problem sequences

3.4 Viewing the training data

The training process results in a training object (trainingSet) of class Taxa and subclass Train that contains
all of the information required for classification. If you want to use the pre-trained classifier for 16S rRNA sequences,
then it can be loaded with the data function. However, if you just trained the classifier using your own training
data then you should skip these next two lines of code.

> data("TrainingSet_16S")
> trainingSet <- TrainingSet_16S

We can view summary properties of the training set (trainingSet) by printing it:

> trainingSet

A training set of class 'Taxa'

* K-mer size: 8
* Number of rank levels: 10
* Total number of sequences: 2472
* Number of groups: 2472
* Number of problem groups: 5
* Number of problem sequences: 8

And, as shown in Figure 1, we can plot the training set (trainingSet) to view a variety of information:

1. The first panel contains the taxonomic tree with the “Root” at the very top. This training set contains different
numbers of ranks for each group, which is why the leaves of the tree end at different heights. Edges of the tree
that are colored show putative “problem groups” that persist after the iterative removal of “problem sequences”
(see above). These colored edges are problematic in that the classifier cannot descend below this edge on the
tree during the initial “tree descent” phase of the algorithm and, instead, must test against every sequence below
this edge. This slows down the classification process for sequences belonging to a group below this edge, but
does not affect the classifier’s accuracy.

2. The second panel of Fig. 1 shows the number of unique groups at each taxonomic rank, ordered from highest to
lowest taxonomic rank in the dataset. We can see that there are about 2.5 thousand genera, where genus is the
lowest rank in this training set.

3. The bottom left panel contains a histogram of the number of sequences per label. The maximum group size is
in accordance with the maxGroupSize set above. Here, the pre-trained classified has only a single sequence per
group so that it will take up minimal space. Typically classifiers will have a wide distribution of the number of
sequences per group.

4. The bottom right panel displays the inverse document frequency (IDF) weights associated with each k-mer.
We can see that there are many rare k-mers that have high weights (i.e., high information content), and a few
common k-mers that have very low weights. This highly-skewed distribution of information content among
k-mers is typical among sequence data.

Now that we have trained the classifier, the next step is to use it to assign taxonomic classifications to new sequences.
This is accomplished with the IdTaxa function, which takes in “test” (new) sequences along with the training set
(trainingSet) object that was returned by LearnTaxa. For the purposes of this tutorial, we are going to use
some 16S rRNA gene sequences collected from organisms present in tap water. Feel free to follow along with your
own sequences, or load the FASTA file included with the tutorial.

> fas <- "<<path to FASTA file>>"
> # OR use the example 16S sequences:
> fas <- system.file("extdata",

"Bacteria_175seqs.fas",
package="DECIPHER")

> # read the sequences into memory
> test <- readDNAStringSet(fas)
> # Alternatively use readAAStringSet or readRNAStringSet

As in training (above), the test sequences cannot contain gap (“-” or “.”) characters, which can easily be removed with
the RemoveGaps function:

> # if they exist, remove any gaps in the sequences:
> test <- RemoveGaps(test)
> test

4.1 Assigning classifications

Now, for the moment we have been waiting for: it’s time to classify some test sequences! It’s important to have read the
help file for IdTaxa to acquaint yourself with the available options before performing this step. The most important
(optional) arguments are the type of output, the strand used in testing, the confidence threshold of assignments, and
the number of processors to use. Here, we are going to request the "extended" (default) output type that allows
for plotting the results, but there is also a "collapsed" type that might be easier to export (see section 4.4 below).
Also, we know that all of the test sequences are in the same (“+” strand) orientation as the training sequences, so
we can specify to only look at the "top" strand rather than the default of "both" strands (i.e., both “+” and “-”
strands). This makes the classification process over twice as fast. We could also set processors to NULL to use all
available processors.

> ids <- IdTaxa(test,
trainingSet,

7

type="extended",
strand="top",
threshold=60,
processors=1)

|===========================================================================| 100%

Time difference of 12.23 secs

The threshold of 60% is recommended at the default confidence threshold. Confidence levels are informally
defined as 70% (stringent), 60% (cautious), 50% (sensible), and 40% (lenient). Using a threshold of 0% will
report classifications down to all rank levels. Note that the test sequences should generally be fully-overlapped by the
information in the training sequences. In this way, the training sequences can be longer than the test sequences, but
the reverse situation would result in lower confidences.
Let’s look at the results by printing the object (ids) that was returned:

Note that the data has class Taxa and subclass Test, which is stored as an object of type list. Therefore we can
access a subset of the returned object (ids) with single square brackets ([) or access the contents of individual list
elements with double square brackets ([[). The allows the classifications to be subset and merged, as shown in the
examples below.

4.2 Plotting the results

We can also plot the results, as shown in Figure 2. This produces a pie chart showing the relative abundance of the
taxonomic groups assigned to test sequences. It also displays the training taxonomic tree, with edges colored where
they match the taxonomic groups shown in the pie chart. Note that we could also have only plotted the pie chart by
omitting the trainingSet. Also, it is possible to specify the parameter n if each classification represents a varying
number of sequences, e.g., when only unique sequences were originally classified.

When analyzing multiple samples, it is often useful to create a classification table with the number of times each
taxon is observed. Here we can choose a specific taxonomic rank to consider, or simply select the lowest (i.e., basal)
taxonomic level:

> phylum <- sapply(ids,

function(x) {

w <- which(x$rank=="phylum")
if (length(w) != 1) {

"unknown"

} else {

x$taxon[w]

}

})

> table(phylum)

"Desulfosporosinus"

"unclassified_Root"

Next, we need to know which test sequences belonged to each sample. This must be in the form of a vector of sample
names that is the same length as the number of samples. For example, in this case the sample names are part of the
sequence names. Using this vector we can easily generate a classification table:

> # get a vector with the sample name for each sequence
> samples <- gsub(".*; (.+?)_.*", "\\1", names(test))
> taxaTbl <- table(taxon, samples)
> taxaTbl <- t(t(taxaTbl)/colSums(taxaTbl)) # normalize by sample
> head(taxaTbl)

We can summarize the results in a stacked barplot:

We can switch between outputting in extended or collapsed format by setting the type argument in IdTaxa.
The collapsed type of output is simply a character vector, which cannot be plotted but is easy to write to a text file
with the writeLines function. In this tutorial we requested the extended type of output, which is stored in a list
structure that must be converted into a character vector before we can write it to a text file. Here we may choose what
we want the text output to look like, by pasting together the result for each sequence using delimiters. For example:

> output <- sapply(ids,

function (id) {

paste(id$taxon,

" (",
round(id$confidence, digits=1),
"%)",
sep="",
collapse="; ")

})

> tail(output)

4.5 Guaranteeing repeatability

The IDTAXA algorithm uses bootstrapping, which involves random sampling to obtain a confidence score. For this
reason, the classifications are expected to change slightly if the classification process is repeated with the same inputs.
For some applications this randomness is undesirable, and it can easily be avoided by setting the random seed before
classification. The process of setting and then unsetting the seed in R is straightforward:

> set.seed(123) # choose a whole number as the random seed
> # then classify sequences with IdTaxa (not shown)
> set.seed(NULL) # return to the original state by unsetting the seed

5 Creating a “taxid” file

The “taxid” file format supplies a table that can be used by LearnTaxa to specify taxonomic ranks (e.g., phylum,
class, order, etc.) associated with each taxon. Previously we imported the rank information from a plain text file
containing 5 columns separate by asterisks (“*”). An example of the contents of this file is:

15

0*Root*-1*0*rootrank
1*Bacteria*0*1*domain
2*Actinobacteria*1*2*phylum
3*Acidimicrobiales*2*3*order
4*Acidimicrobiaceae*3*4*family
5*Acidimicrobium*4*5*genus
6*Ferrimicrobium*4*5*genus
...

The leftmost column is simply an index starting at zero. Next, there is a column with each unique taxonomic
name in the training set. The third column contains a pointer to the index of each line’s parent. The fourth column
gives the rank level starting from “Root” at level 0. The last column provides the taxonomic rank information that is
used by LearnTaxa.

The first line is always the same, and specifies that the “Root” rank is index 0, has no parent (-1), and points to
itself (index 0). The rest of the lines must point to a positive index for their parent. For example, the line for index 6
states that the genus “Ferrimicrobium” exist within the family “Acidimicrobiaceae” (index 4) at rank level 5.

If you would like to create a custom “taxid” file for your training set, the easiest way is to start with a set of
taxonomic labels preceded by prefixes indicating their rank. For example, the above “taxid” file could be generated
from these lines of text:

d__Bacteria;p__Actinobacteria;o__Acidimicrobiales;f__Acidimicrobiaceae;g__Acidimicrobium
d__Bacteria;p__Actinobacteria;o__Acidimicrobiales;f__Acidimicrobiaceae;g__Ferrimicrobium
...

Then the following code will convert this text into the fields required for the “taxid” file:

> ranks <- readLines("<<path to lines of text>>")
> taxa <- setNames(c("domain", "phylum", "order", "family", "genus"),

c("d__", "p__", "o__", "f__", "g__"))

> ranks <- strsplit(ranks, ";", fix=T)
> count <- 1L
> groups <- "Root"
> index <- -1L
> level <- 0L
> rank <- "rootrank"
> pBar <- txtProgressBar(style=3)
> for (i in seq_along(ranks)) {

for (j in seq_along(ranks[[i]])) {

rank_level <- taxa[substring(ranks[[i]][j], 1, 3)]
group <- substring(ranks[[i]][j], 4)
w <- which(groups==group & rank==rank_level)
if (length(w) > 0) {

parent <- match(substring(ranks[[i]][j - 1], 4),

groups)

if (j==1 || any((parent - 1L)==index[w]))

next # already included

}

count <- count + 1L
groups <- c(groups, group)
if (j==1) {

index <- c(index, 0)

16

} else {

parent <- match(substring(ranks[[i]][j - 1], 4),

groups)

index <- c(index,

parent - 1L)

}
level <- c(level, j)
rank <- c(rank, taxa[j])

}

setTxtProgressBar(pBar, i/length(ranks))

}

> groups <- gsub("^[ ]+", "", groups)
> groups <- gsub("[ ]+$", "", groups)
> taxid <- paste(0:(length(index) - 1L), groups, index, level, rank, sep="*")
> head(taxid, n=10)

[1] "0*Root*-1*0*rootrank"
[2] "1*Bacteria*0*1*domain"
[3] "2*Actinobacteria*1*2*phylum"
[4] "3*Acidimicrobiales*2*3*order"
[5] "4*Acidimicrobiaceae*3*4*family"
[6] "5*Acidimicrobium*4*5*genus"
[7] "6*Ferrimicrobium*4*5*genus"

Now these lines of text can be written to a file to be imported as the “taxid” file above.

> writeLines(taxid,

con="<<path to taxid file>>")

6 Annotating Protein Sequences

The IDTAXA algorithm can also be used to classify amino acid sequences into a taxonomy of genes, functions, or
organisms. As an example, we can train the classifier on the set of named genes from the phylum Planctobacteria. Sets
such as this can be constructed from various databases, including https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=reviewedSwissProt.
The example training sequences can be loaded with:

> fas <- system.file("extdata",

"PlanctobacteriaNamedGenes.fas.gz",
package="DECIPHER")
> aa <- readAAStringSet(fas)
> aa

Here, protein sequences are named by their enzyme commission (EC) number and three or four-letter gene name. It is
important to only train the classifier with sequences having complete labels. In this case, we will get rid of sequences
without any EC number.

Since this taxonomy contains widely disparate sequences, we would not expect tree descent to be useful. We can
disable tree descent by setting maxChildren to 1 in LearnTaxa.

> trainingSet <- LearnTaxa(train=aa,
taxonomy=names(aa),
maxChildren=1)

Next we need a set of query sequences to classify. To this end, we will use a representative genome of the Chlamydia
trachomatis species, a member of the Planctobacteria phylum. We can find genes in the genome using the DECIPHER
function FindGenes.

> fas <- system.file("extdata",

"Chlamydia_trachomatis_NC_000117.fas.gz",
package="DECIPHER")

> genome <- readDNAStringSet(fas)
> genes <- FindGenes(genome, verbose=FALSE)

Now, we can take advantage of the fact that our training and testing sets are composed of full-length sequences by
setting fullLength to 0.99 in IdTaxa. This will automatically infer the expected length variability among proteins,
and filter potential classifications to only those within a reasonable length range. Furthermore, we will lower the
threshold to 50%, the recommended value for protein sequences.

> ids <- IdTaxa(test,
trainingSet,
fullLength=0.99,
threshold=50,
processors=1)

Since only about a third of the proteins are classifiable in this dataset, we can display the subset of genes that did not
belong to “unclassified_Root”. To make the plot more interesting, we will subset to the first EC number.
We see that most genes either are not placed in a class with an EC number or belong to EC 2 (Transferases) or EC 3
(Hydrolases).
