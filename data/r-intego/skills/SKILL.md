# r-intego

name: r-intego
description: Use this skill when working with the R package "intego" to integrate multiple Gene Ontology (GO) semantic similarity measures. This is useful for functional genomics tasks, such as gene clustering or gene function prediction, where a single robust similarity score is needed from multiple underlying GO-based metrics.

# r-intego

## Overview
The `intego` package (Integrated Gene Ontology) provides tools to integrate different semantic similarity measures between genes based on Gene Ontology. By combining multiple measures, it aims to provide a more reliable and comprehensive functional similarity score than any single metric alone. It specifically implements the InteGO and InteGO2 algorithms.

## Installation
To install the package from CRAN:
```R
install.packages("intego")
```

## Main Functions
The package focuses on two primary integration functions:

- `InteGO1(similarity_matrices)`: Implements the initial integration approach. It takes a list of similarity matrices (each calculated using a different semantic similarity measure) and returns a single integrated matrix.
- `InteGO2(similarity_matrices)`: Implements the updated integration approach, which is generally more robust for handling diverse semantic similarity inputs.

## Workflow
1. **Calculate Individual Similarities**: Use external packages like `GOSemSim` to calculate several different semantic similarity matrices (e.g., Resnik, Lin, Wang) for the same set of genes.
2. **Prepare Input**: Combine these matrices into a list. Ensure that all matrices have the same dimensions and the same row/column names (gene identifiers).
3. **Integrate**: Apply `InteGO1` or `InteGO2` to the list.
4. **Analysis**: Use the resulting integrated similarity matrix for downstream tasks like hierarchical clustering (`hclust`) or visualization.

## Tips
- **Consistency**: Ensure that the gene sets are identical across all input matrices before integration.
- **Selection**: `InteGO2` is typically preferred for most modern functional genomics workflows as it handles the variance between different semantic similarity methods more effectively.
- **Data Source**: The quality of the integration depends on the diversity of the input measures; using a mix of information-content-based and graph-based measures often yields the best results.
