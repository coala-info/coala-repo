# picard

## Overview

Picard is a robust suite of Java-based command-line utilities designed for the manipulation and analysis of high-throughput sequencing data. It is widely recognized for its strict adherence to the SAM format specification, making it the primary tool for validating file integrity and preparing data for downstream variant calling (e.g., GATK). Unlike many bioinformatics tools that use POSIX-style flags, Picard uses a specific `KEY=VALUE` syntax for its arguments.

## Core Command Syntax

Execute Picard tools using the following pattern:

```bash
java [jvm-args] -jar picard.jar [ToolName] OPTION1=value1 OPTION2=value2 ...
```

### Essential JVM Arguments
*   **Memory Allocation**: Always specify the maximum heap size using `-Xmx`. For most tools, `-Xmx2g` to `-Xmx4g` is sufficient, but `MarkDuplicates` and `SortSam` may require more for large datasets.
*   **Garbage Collection**: To prevent Picard from consuming all available CPU cores for background tasks, use `-XX:ParallelGCThreads=1`.

## Standard Options and Best Practices

Most Picard tools support a set of common parameters that significantly impact performance and reliability:

| Option | Recommendation |
| :--- | :--- |
| `VALIDATION_STRINGENCY` | Use `STRICT` (default) for production. Use `LENIENT` or `SILENT` if dealing with non-standard aligner output that causes minor validation errors. |
| `CREATE_INDEX` | Set to `true` when writing coordinate-sorted BAM files to generate the `.bai` index automatically. |
| `MAX_RECORDS_IN_RAM` | Adjust based on available memory. A rule of thumb is 250,000 records per 1GB of JVM heap. |
| `TMP_DIR` | Specify a high-performance scratch directory for tools that perform disk-based sorting (e.g., `SortSam`, `MarkDuplicates`). |

## High-Utility Workflows

### Marking Duplicates
`MarkDuplicates` identifies PCR or optical duplicates. It is memory-intensive because it tracks read-end coordinates.
```bash
java -Xmx4g -jar picard.jar MarkDuplicates \
      I=input.bam \
      O=marked_duplicates.bam \
      M=marked_dup_metrics.txt \
      CREATE_INDEX=true
```

### Adding or Replacing Read Groups
Many downstream tools require specific Read Group (`@RG`) information in the BAM header.
```bash
java -jar picard.jar AddOrReplaceReadGroups \
      I=input.bam \
      O=output.bam \
      RGID=4 RGLB=lib1 RGPL=illumina RGPU=unit1 RGSM=sample1
```

### Validating SAM/BAM Files
Use `ValidateSamFile` to troubleshoot errors or ensure a file is ready for GATK.
```bash
java -jar picard.jar ValidateSamFile \
      I=input.bam \
      MODE=SUMMARY
```

### Piping and Streaming
To read from stdin or write to stdout, use `/dev/stdin` and `/dev/stdout`. Set `QUIET=true` to prevent log messages from corrupting the stdout stream.
```bash
samtools view -u input.bam | java -jar picard.jar SortSam \
      I=/dev/stdin \
      O=/dev/stdout \
      SORT_ORDER=coordinate \
      QUIET=true > sorted.bam
```

## Expert Tips
*   **Cleaning Files**: If a file has alignments extending past the end of a reference contig, use `CleanSam` to soft-clip the offending reads.
*   **Duplicate Removal**: By default, `MarkDuplicates` only flags reads. To physically remove them, set `REMOVE_DUPLICATES=true`.
*   **Sorting Performance**: If `SortSam` is slow, increase `MAX_RECORDS_IN_RAM` and ensure `TMP_DIR` points to a fast local disk (SSD) rather than a slow network mount.
*   **CRAM Support**: Picard supports CRAM, but you must provide the `REFERENCE_SEQUENCE` path for both reading and writing.



## Subcommands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| AccumulateQualityYieldMetrics | Combines multiple QualityYieldMetrics files into a single file. This tool is used in cases where the metrics are calculated separately on shards of the same read-group. |
| AccumulateVariantCallingMetrics | Combines multiple Variant Calling Metrics files into a single file. This tool is used in cases where the metrics are calculated separately for different (genomic) shards of the same callset and we want to combine them into a single result over the entire callset. |
| AddCommentsToBam | Adds comments to the header of a BAM file. This tool makes a copy of the input bam file, with a modified header that includes the comments specified at the command line (prefixed by @CO). |
| AddOATag | This tool takes in an aligned SAM or BAM and adds the OA tag to every aligned read unless an interval list is specified, where it only adds the tag to reads that fall within the intervals in the interval list. This can be useful if you are about to realign but want to keep the original alignment information as a separate tag. |
| AddOrReplaceReadGroups | Assigns all the reads in a file to a single new read-group. |
| BaitDesigner | Designs oligonucleotide baits for hybrid selection reactions. This tool is used to design custom bait sets for hybrid selection experiments. It outputs interval_list files of both bait and target sequences as well as the actual bait sequences in FastA format. |
| BamIndexStats | Generate index statistics from a BAM file. This tool calculates statistics from a BAM index (.bai) file, emulating the behavior of the "samtools idxstats" command. The statistics collected include counts of aligned and unaligned reads as well as all records with no start coordinate. |
| BamToBfq | Converts a BAM file into a BFQ (binary fastq formatted) file. The BFQ format is the input format to some tools like Maq aligner. |
| BedToIntervalList | Converts a BED file to a Picard Interval List. This tool provides easy conversion from BED to the Picard interval_list format which is required by many Picard processing tools. |
| BpmToNormalizationManifestCsv | BpmToNormalizationManifestCsv takes an Illumina BPM (Bead Pool Manifest) file and generates an Illumina-formatted bpm.csv file from it. A bpm.csv is a file that was generated by an old version of Illumina's Autocall software. Since it contained normalization IDs (needed to calculate normalized intensities), it came into use in several programs notably zCall (https://github.com/jigold/zCall). |
| BuildBamIndex | Generates a BAM index ".bai" file. This tool creates an index file for the input BAM that allows fast look-up of data in a BAM file, like an index on a database. Note that this tool cannot be run on SAM files, and that the input BAM file must be sorted in coordinate order. |
| CalculateFingerprintMetrics | Calculate statistics on fingerprints, checking their viability. This tool collects various statistics that pertain to a single fingerprint and reports the results in a metrics file. |
| CalculateReadGroupChecksum | Creates a hash code based on the read groups (RG). This tool creates a hash code based on identifying information in the read groups (RG) of a ".BAM" or "SAM" file header. Addition or removal of RGs changes the hash code, enabling the user to quickly determine if changes have been made to the read group information. |
| CheckDuplicateMarking | This tool checks that all reads with the same queryname have their duplicate marking flags set the same way. NOTE: This tool does NOT check that the duplicate marking is correct. The ONLY thing that it checks is that the 0x400 bit-flags of records with the same queryname are equal. |
| CheckFingerprint | Checks the sample identity of the sequence/genotype data in the provided file (SAM/BAM/CRAM or VCF) against a set of known genotypes in the supplied genotype file (in VCF format). |
| CheckIlluminaDirectory | Asserts the validity for specified Illumina basecalling data. This tool will check that the basecall directory and the internal files are available, exist, and are reasonably sized for every tile and cycle. |
| CheckTerminatorBlock | Asserts the provided gzip file's (e.g., BAM) last block is well-formed; RC 100 otherwise |
| CleanSam | Cleans a SAM/BAM/CRAM files, soft-clipping beyond-end-of-reference alignments and setting MAPQ to 0 for unmapped reads |
| ClusterCrosscheckMetrics | Clusters the results from a CrosscheckFingerprints run according to the LOD score. Two groups are connected if they have a LOD score greater than the LOD_THRESHOLD. All groups in a cluster are related to each other either directly or indirectly. |
| CollectAlignmentSummaryMetrics | Produces a summary of alignment metrics from a SAM or BAM file. This tool takes a SAM/BAM file input and produces metrics detailing the quality of the read alignments as well as the proportion of the reads that passed machine signal-to-noise threshold quality filters. |
| CollectArraysVariantCallingMetrics | CollectArraysVariantCallingMetrics takes a Genotyping Arrays VCF file (as generated by GtcToVcf) and calculates summary and per-sample metrics. |
| CollectBaseDistributionByCycle | Chart the nucleotide distribution per cycle in a SAM or BAM file in order to enable assessment of systematic errors at specific positions in the reads. |
| CollectDuplicateMetrics | Collect Duplicate metrics from marked file. This tool only collects the duplicate metrics from a file that has already been duplicate-marked. |
| CollectGcBiasMetrics | Collect metrics regarding GC bias. This tool collects information about the relative proportions of guanine (G) and cytosine (C) nucleotides in a sample. Regions of high and low G + C content have been shown to interfere with mapping/aligning, ultimately leading to fragmented genome assemblies and poor coverage. |
| CollectHiSeqXPfFailMetrics | Classify PF-Failing reads in a HiSeqX Illumina Basecalling directory into various categories. This tool categorizes the reads that did not pass filter (PF-Failing) into four groups: MISALIGNED, EMPTY, POLYCLONAL, and UNKNOWN. |
| CollectHsMetrics | Collects hybrid-selection (HS) metrics for a SAM or BAM file. This tool takes a SAM/BAM file input and collects metrics that are specific for sequence datasets generated through hybrid-selection. |
| CollectIlluminaBasecallingMetrics | Collects Illumina Basecalling metrics for a sequencing run. This tool will produce per-barcode and per-lane basecall metrics for each sequencing run. Mean values for each metric are determined using data from all of the tiles. |
| CollectIlluminaLaneMetrics | Collects Illumina lane metrics for the given BaseCalling analysis directory. This tool produces quality control metrics on cluster density for each lane of an Illumina flowcell. This tool takes Illumina TileMetrics data and places them into directories containing lane- and phasing-level metrics. |
| CollectIndependentReplicateMetrics | Estimates the rate of independent replication rate of reads within a bam. This tool estimates the fraction of the input reads which would be marked as duplicates but are actually biological replicates, independent observations of the data. |
| CollectInsertSizeMetrics | Collect metrics about the insert size distribution of a paired-end library. This tool provides useful metrics for validating library construction including the insert size distribution and read orientation of paired-end libraries. |
| CollectJumpingLibraryMetrics | Collects high-level metrics about the presence of outward-facing (jumping) and inward-facing (non-jumping) read pairs within a SAM/BAM/CRAM file. |
| CollectMultipleMetrics | Collect multiple classes of metrics. This 'meta-metrics' tool runs one or more of the metrics collection modules at the same time to cut down on the time spent reading in data from input files. |
| CollectOxoGMetrics | Collect metrics to assess oxidative artifacts. This tool collects metrics quantifying the error rate resulting from oxidative artifacts. It calculates the Phred-scaled probability that an alternate base call results from an oxidation artifact based on base context, sequencing read orientation, and characteristic low allelic frequency. |
| CollectQualityYieldMetrics | Collect metrics about reads that pass quality thresholds and Illumina-specific filters. This tool evaluates the overall quality of reads within a bam file containing one read group. The output indicates the total numbers of bases within a read group that pass a minimum base quality score threshold and (in the case of Illumina data) pass Illumina quality filters. |

| CollectRrbsMetrics | Collects metrics from reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (Rrbs) data. This tool uses reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (Rrbs) data to determine cytosine methylation status across all reads of a genomic DNA sequence. |
| CollectSamErrorMetrics | Program to collect error metrics on bases stratified in various ways. To estimate the error rate the tool assumes that all differences from the reference are errors. For this to be a reasonable assumption the tool needs to know the sites at which the sample is actually polymorphic and a confidence interval where the user is relatively certain that the polymorphic sites are known and accurate. These two inputs are provided as a VCF and INTERVALS. |
| CollectSequencingArtifactMetrics | Collect metrics to quantify single-base sequencing artifacts. This tool examines two sources of sequencing errors associated with hybrid selection protocols: pre-adapter and bait-bias. |

| CollectUmiPrevalenceMetrics | Tally the counts of UMIs in duplicate sets within a bam. This tool collects the Histogram of the number of duplicate sets that contain a given number of UMIs. Understanding this distribution can help understand the role that the UMIs have in the determination of consensus sets, the risk of UMI collisions, and of spurious reads that result from uncorrected UMIs. |
| CollectVariantCallingMetrics | Collects per-sample and aggregate (spanning all samples) metrics from the provided VCF file. |
| CollectWgsMetrics | Collect metrics about coverage and performance of whole genome sequencing (WGS) experiments. This tool collects metrics about the fractions of reads that pass base- and mapping-quality filters as well as coverage (read-depth) levels for WGS analyses. |
| CollectWgsMetricsWithNonZeroCoverage | Collect metrics about coverage and performance of whole genome sequencing (WGS) experiments. This tool collects metrics about the percentages of reads that pass base- and mapping- quality filters as well as coverage (read-depth) levels. This extends CollectWgsMetrics by including metrics related only to sites with non-zero (>0) coverage. |
| CombineGenotypingArrayVcfs | CombineGenotypingArrayVcfs takes one or more VCF files, as generated by GtcToVcf and combines them into a single VCF. The input VCFs must have the same sequence dictionary and same list of variant loci. The input VCFs must not share sample Ids. |
| CompareGtcFiles | CompareGtcFiles takes two Illumina GTC file and compares their contents to ensure that fields expected to be the same are in fact the same. This will exclude any variable field, such as a date. The GTC files must be generated on the same chip type. |
| CompareMetrics | Compare two metrics files. This tool compares the metrics and histograms generated from metric tools to determine if the generated results are identical. Note that if there are differences in metric values, this tool describes those differences as the change of the second input metric relative to the first. |
| CompareSAMs | Compare two input SAM/BAM/CRAM files. This tool initially compares the headers of the input files. If the file headers are comparable, the tool can perform either strict comparisons for which each alignment and the header must be identical, or a more lenient check of "equivalence". Results of comparison are summarised in an output metrics file. |
| ConvertHaplotypeDatabaseToVcf | Convert Haplotype database file to vcf |
| ConvertSequencingArtifactToOxoG | Extract OxoG metrics from generalized artifacts metrics. This tool extracts 8-oxoguanine (OxoG) artifact metrics from the output of CollectSequencingArtifactsMetrics and converts them to the CollectOxoGMetrics tool's output format. |
| CreateBafRegressMetricsFile | CreateBafRegressMetricsFile takes an output file as generated by the bafRegress tool and creates a picard metrics file. BAFRegress is a software that detects and estimates sample contamination using B allele frequency data from Illumina genotyping arrays using a regression model. |
| CreateExtendedIlluminaManifest | CreateExtendedIlluminaManifest takes an Illumina manifest file (this is the text version of an Illumina '.bpm' file) and creates an 'extended' version of this text file by adding fields that facilitate VCF generation by downstream tools. As part of generating this extended version of the manifest, the tool may mark loci as 'FAIL' if they do not pass validation. |
| CreateSequenceDictionary | Creates a sequence dictionary for a reference sequence. This tool creates a sequence dictionary file (with ".dict" extension) from a reference sequence provided in FASTA format, which is required by many processing and analysis tools. |
| CreateVerifyIDIntensityContaminationMetricsFile | CreateVerifyIDIntensityContaminationMetricsFile takes an output file as generated by the VerifyIDIntensity tool and creates a picard metrics file. VerifyIDIntensity is a tool for detecting and estimating sample contamination of Illumina genotyping array data. |
| CrosscheckFingerprints | Checks the odds that all data in the set of input files come from the same individual. Can be used to cross-check readgroups, libraries, samples, or files. Acceptable inputs include BAM/SAM/CRAM and VCF/GVCF files. Output delivers LOD scores in the form of a CrosscheckMetric file. |
| DownsampleSam | Downsample a SAM or BAM file. This tool applies a downsampling algorithm to a SAM or BAM file to retain only a (deterministically random) subset of the reads. Reads from the same template (e.g. read-pairs, secondary and supplementary reads) are all either kept or discarded as a unit. |
| EstimateLibraryComplexity | Estimates the numbers of unique molecules in a sequencing library. This tool outputs quality metrics for a sequencing library preparation. Library complexity refers to the number of unique DNA fragments present in a given library. |
| ExtractFingerprint | Computes/Extracts the fingerprint genotype likelihoods from the supplied file. It is given as a list of PLs at the fingerprinting sites. |
| ExtractIlluminaBarcodes | Tool determines the barcode for each read in an Illumina lane. This tool determines the numbers of reads containing barcode-matching sequences and provides statistics on the quality of these barcode matches. |
| ExtractSequences | Subsets intervals from a reference sequence to a new FASTA file. This tool takes a list of intervals, reads the corresponding subsquences from a reference FASTA file and writes them to a new FASTA file as separate records. |
| FastqToSam | Converts a FASTQ file to an unaligned BAM or SAM file. Output read records will contain the original base calls and quality scores will be translated depending on the base quality score encoding: FastqSanger, FastqSolexa and FastqIllumina. |
| FifoBuffer | Acts as a large memory buffer between processes that are connected with unix pipes for the case that one or more processes produces or consumes their input or output in bursts. By inserting a large memory buffer between such processes each process can run at full speed and the bursts can be smoothed out by the memory buffer. |
| FilterSamReads | Subsets reads from a SAM/BAM/CRAM file by applying one of several filters. Takes a SAM/BAM/CRAM file and subsets it by either excluding or only including certain reads such as aligned or unaligned reads, specific reads based on a list of reads names, an interval list, by Tag Values (type Z / String values only), or using a JavaScript script. |
| FilterVcf | Applies one or more hard filters to a VCF file to filter out genotypes and variants. |
| FindMendelianViolations | Takes in VCF or BCF and a pedigree file and looks for high confidence calls where the genotype of the offspring is incompatible with the genotypes of the parents. |
| FixMateInformation | Verify mate-pair information between mates and fix if needed. This tool ensures that all mate-pair information is in sync between each read and its mate pair. If no OUTPUT file is supplied then the output is written to a temporary file and then copied over the INPUT file (with the original placed in a .old file.) Reads marked with the secondary alignment flag are written to the output file unchanged. However supplementary reads are corrected so that they point to the primary, non-supplemental mate record. |
| FixVcfHeader | Replaces or fixes a VCF header. This tool will either replace the header in the input VCF file (INPUT) with the given VCF header (HEADER) or will attempt to fill in any field definitions that are missing in the input header by examining the variants in the input VCF file (INPUT). |
| GatherBamFiles | Concatenate efficiently BAM files that resulted from a scattered parallel analysis. This tool performs a rapid 'gather' or concatenation on BAM files. This is often needed in operations that have been run in parallel across genomics regions by scattering their execution across computing nodes and cores thus resulting in smaller BAM files. |
| GatherVcfs | Gathers multiple VCF files from a scatter operation into a single VCF file. Input files must be supplied in genomic order and must not have events at overlapping positions. |
| GenotypeConcordance | Calculates the concordance between genotype data of one sample in each of two VCFs - truth (or reference) vs. calls. The concordance is broken into separate results sections for SNPs and indels. Summary and detailed statistics are reported. |
| GtcToVcf | GtcToVcf takes an Illumina GTC file and converts it to a VCF file using several supporting files. A GTC file is an Illumina-specific file containing called genotypes in AA/AB/BB format. A VCF, aka Variant Calling Format, is a text file for storing how a sequenced sample differs from the reference genome. |
| IdentifyContaminant | Computes the fingerprint genotype likelihoods from the supplied SAM/BAM file and a contamination estimate. The fingerprint is provided for the contamination (by default) for the main sample. It is given as a list of PLs at the fingerprinting sites. |
| IlluminaBasecallsToFastq | Generate FASTQ file(s) from Illumina basecall read data. This tool generates FASTQ files from data in an Illumina BaseCalls output directory. Separate FASTQ files are created for each template, barcode, and index (molecular barcode) read. |
| IlluminaBasecallsToSam | Transforms raw Illumina sequencing data into an unmapped SAM, BAM or CRAM file. The IlluminaBaseCallsToSam program collects, demultiplexes, and sorts reads across all of the tiles of a lane via barcode to produce an unmapped SAM, BAM or CRAM file. |
| IntervalListToBed | Converts an Picard IntervalList file to a BED file. |
| IntervalListTools | A tool for performing various IntervalList manipulations including sorting, merging, subtracting, padding, and other set-theoretic operations. Both IntervalList and VCF files are accepted as input. |
| LiftOverHaplotypeMap | Lifts over a haplotype database from one reference to another. Based on UCSC liftOver. Uses a UCSC chain file to guide the liftOver. |
| LiftOverIntervalList | Lifts over an interval list from one reference build to another. This tool adjusts the coordinates in an interval list on one reference to its homologous interval list on another reference, based on a chain file that describes the correspondence between the two references. |
| LiftoverVcf | Lifts over a VCF file from one reference build to another, producing a properly headered, sorted and indexed VCF in one go. |
| MakeSitesOnlyVcf | This tool reads a VCF/VCF.gz/BCF and removes all genotype information from it while retaining all site level information, including annotations based on genotypes (e.g. AN, AF). Output can be any supported variant format including .vcf, .vcf.gz or .bcf. |
| MakeVcfSampleNameMap | Creates a TSV from sample name to VCF/GVCF path, with one line per input. Input VCF/GVCFs must contain a header describing exactly one sample. |
| MarkDuplicates | Identifies duplicate reads. This tool locates and tags duplicate reads in a SAM, BAM or CRAM file, where duplicate reads are defined as originating from a single fragment of DNA. MarkDuplicates also produces a metrics file indicating the numbers of duplicates for both single- and paired-end reads. |
| MarkDuplicatesWithMateCigar | Identifies duplicate reads, accounting for mate CIGAR. This tool locates and tags duplicate reads (both PCR and optical) in a BAM, SAM or CRAM file, where duplicate reads are defined as originating from the same original fragment of DNA, taking into account the CIGAR string of read mates. |
| MarkIlluminaAdapters | Reads a SAM/BAM/CRAM file and rewrites it with new adapter-trimming tags. This tool clears any existing adapter-trimming tags (XT:i:) in the optional tag region of the input file. The SAM/BAM/CRAM file must be sorted by query name. Outputs a metrics file histogram showing counts of bases_clipped per read. |
| MeanQualityByCycle | Collect mean quality by cycle. This tool generates a data table and chart of mean quality by cycle from a BAM file. It is intended to be used on a single lane or a read group's worth of data, but can be applied to merged BAMs if needed. |
| MergeBamAlignment | Merge alignment data from a SAM or BAM with data in an unmapped BAM file. A command-line tool for merging BAM/SAM alignment info from a third-party aligner with the data in an unmapped BAM file, producing a third BAM file that has alignment data (from the aligner) and all the remaining data from the unmapped BAM. |
| MergePedIntoVcf | MergePedIntoVcf takes a single-sample ped file output from zCall and merges into a single-sample vcf file using several supporting files. |
| MergeSamFiles | Merges multiple SAM/BAM/CRAM (and/or) files into a single file. This tool is used for combining SAM/BAM/CRAM (and/or) files from different runs or read groups into a single file, similarly to the "merge" function of Samtools. |
| MergeVcfs | Combines multiple variant files into a single variant file. |
| NonNFastaSize | Counts the number of non-N bases in a fasta file. This tool takes any FASTA-formatted file and counts the number of non-N bases in it. Note that it requires that the fasta file have associated index (.fai) and dictionary (.dict) files. |
| NormalizeFasta | Normalizes lines of sequence in a FASTA file to be of the same length. This tool takes any FASTA-formatted file and reformats the sequence to ensure that all of the sequence record lines are of the same length (with the exception of the last line). |
| PositionBasedDownsampleSam | Class to downsample a SAM/BAM/CRAM file based on the position of the read in a flowcell. As with DownsampleSam, all the reads with the same queryname are either kept or dropped as a unit. |
| QualityScoreDistribution | Chart the distribution of quality scores. This tool is used for determining the overall 'quality' for a library in a given run. It outputs a chart and tables indicating the range of quality scores and the total numbers of bases corresponding to those scores. |
| RenameSampleInVcf | This tool enables the user to rename a sample in either a VCF or BCF file. It is intended to change the name of a sample in a VCF prior to merging with VCF files in which one or more samples have similar names. Note that the input VCF file must be single-sample VCF and that the NEW_SAMPLE_NAME is required. |
| ReorderSam | Reorders reads in a SAM/BAM/CRAM file to match the contig ordering in a provided reference file, as determined by exact name matching of contigs. Reads mapped to contigs absent in the new reference are unmapped. |
| ReplaceSamHeader | Replaces the SAMFileHeader in a SAM/BAM/CRAM file. This tool makes it possible to replace the header of a SAM/BAM/CRAM file with the header of another file, or a header block that has been edited manually (in a stub SAM file). The sort order (@SO) of the two input files must be the same. |
| RevertOriginalBaseQualitiesAndAddMateCigar | Reverts the original base qualities and adds the mate cigar tag to read-group files. |
| RevertSam | Reverts SAM/BAM/CRAM files to a previous state. This tool removes or restores certain properties of the SAM records, including alignment information, which can be used to produce an unmapped BAM (uBAM) from a previously aligned BAM. |
| SamFormatConverter | Convert a BAM file to a SAM file, or SAM to BAM. Input and output formats are determined by file extension. |
| SamToFastq | Converts a SAM/BAM/CRAM file to FASTQ. Extracts read sequences and qualities from the input SAM/BAM/CRAM file and writes them into the output file in Sanger FASTQ format. |
| SamToFastqWithTags | Converts a SAM or BAM file to FASTQ alongside FASTQs created from tags. Extracts read sequences and qualities from the input SAM/BAM file and SAM/BAM tags and writes them into the output file in Sanger FASTQ format. |
| ScatterIntervalsByNs | Writes an interval list created by splitting a reference at Ns. A Program for breaking up a reference into intervals of alternating regions of N and ACGT bases. Used for creating a broken-up interval list that can be used for scattering a variant-calling pipeline in a way that will not cause problems at the edges of the intervals. |
| SetNmMdAndUqTags | This tool takes in a coordinate-sorted SAM/BAM/CRAM and calculates the NM, MD, and UQ tags by comparing with the reference. This may be needed when MergeBamAlignment was run with SORT_ORDER other than 'coordinate' and thus could not fix these tags then. The input must be coordinate sorted in order to run. If specified, the MD and NM tags can be ignored and only the UQ tag be set. |
| SimpleMarkDuplicatesWithMateCigar | Examines aligned records in the supplied SAM/BAM/CRAM file to locate duplicate molecules. All records are then written to the output file with the duplicate records flagged. |
| SortGff | This tool sorts a gff3 file by coordinates, so that it can be indexed. It additionally adds flush directives where possible, which can significantly reduce the memory footprint of downstream tools. Sorting of multiple contigs can be specified by a sequence dictionary; if no sequence dictionary is specified, contigs are sorted lexicographically. |
| SortSam | This tool sorts the input SAM or BAM file by coordinate, queryname (QNAME), or some other property of the SAM record. |
| SortVcf | Sorts one or more VCF files. This tool sorts the records in VCF files according to the order of the contigs in the header/sequence dictionary and then by coordinate. It can accept an external sequence dictionary. If no external dictionary is supplied, the VCF file headers of multiple inputs must have the same sequence dictionaries. |
| SplitSamByLibrary | Takes a SAM/BAM/CRAM file and separates all the reads into one output file per library name. Reads that do not have a read group specified or whose read group does not have a library name are written to a file called 'unknown.' |
| SplitSamByNumberOfReads | Splits a SAM/BAM/CRAM file to multiple files. This tool splits the input query-grouped SAM/BAM/CRAM file into multiple files while maintaining the sort order. This can be used to split a large unmapped input in order to parallelize alignment. It will traverse the input twice unless TOTAL_READS_IN_INPUT is provided. |
| SplitVcfs | Splits SNPs and INDELs into separate files. This tool reads in a VCF or BCF file and writes out the SNPs and INDELs it contains to separate files. The headers of the two output files will be identical and index files will be created for both outputs. If records other than SNPs or INDELs are present, set the STRICT option to "false", otherwise the tool will raise an exception and quit. |
| UmiAwareMarkDuplicatesWithMateCigar | Identifies duplicate reads using information from read positions and UMIs. This tool locates and tags duplicate reads in a BAM or SAM file, where duplicate reads are defined as originating from a single fragment of DNA. It is based on the MarkDuplicatesWithMateCigar tool, with added logic to leverage Unique Molecular Identifier (UMI) information. |
| UpdateVcfSequenceDictionary | Takes a VCF and a second file that contains a sequence dictionary and updates the VCF with the new sequence dictionary. |
| ValidateSamFile | Validates a SAM/BAM/CRAM file relative to the SAM format specification. Reports on troubleshooting errors like improper formatting, faulty alignments, incorrect flag values, etc. |
| VcfFormatConverter | Converts VCF to BCF or BCF to VCF. This tool converts files between the plain-text VCF format and its binary compressed equivalent, BCF. Input and output formats are determined by file extensions specified in the file names. |
| VcfToAdpc | VcfToAdpc takes a VCF, as generated by GtcToVcf and generates an Illumina 'adpc.bin' file from it. An adpc.bin file is a binary file containing genotyping array intensity data that can be exported by Illumina's GenomeStudio and Beadstudio analysis tools. The adpc.bin file is used as an input to VerifyIDintensity a tool for detecting and estimating sample contamination of Illumina genotyping array data. |
| VcfToIntervalList | This tool creates a Picard Interval List from a VCF or BCF. It is important that the file extension is included as the file format is determined by the file extension. Variants that were filtered can be included in the output interval list by setting INCLUDE_FILTERED to true. |
| ViewSam | Very simple command that just reads a SAM or BAM file and writes out the header and each record to standard out. When an (optional) intervals file is specified, only records overlapping those intervals will be output. |
