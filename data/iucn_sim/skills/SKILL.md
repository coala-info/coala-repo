name: iucn_sim
description: iucn_sim provides a probabilistic framework for predicting species extinction times by simulating transitions between IUCN Red List categories. Use when user asks to estimate transition rates between threat levels, simulate future biodiversity loss, or project extinction dates for specific species groups.

# iucn_sim

## Overview

The `iucn_sim` tool provides a probabilistic framework for predicting when species might go extinct. By analyzing how species have historically moved between IUCN Red List categories (e.g., from "Least Concern" to "Vulnerable"), the tool estimates transition rates and applies them to a target list of species. This allows researchers to move beyond static threat assessments to dynamic simulations of future biodiversity loss.

## Installation and Setup

The most reliable way to use `iucn_sim` is via a Conda environment to manage its Python and R dependencies.

```bash
# Create and activate a dedicated environment
conda create -n iucn_sim_env iucn_sim
conda activate iucn_sim_env

# Verify installation
iucn_sim --version
```

## Core Workflow

### 1. Define Species Groups
*   **Target Species List**: The specific list of species you want to simulate.
*   **Reference Group**: A larger group (ideally >1,000 species, such as "Mammalia") used to calculate the background transition rates between IUCN statuses.

### 2. Obtain IUCN Data
To run simulations on custom datasets, you typically need an IUCN API key. However, the tool provides access to pre-compiled reference groups that do not require a key.

```bash
# View help for data acquisition
iucn_sim get_iucn_data -h
```

### 3. Run Simulations
The simulation process involves estimating transition rates from the reference group and applying them to the target species over a specified time horizon.

```bash
# General help for all functions
iucn_sim -h
```

## Expert Tips and Best Practices

*   **Reference Group Size**: Ensure your reference group is sufficiently large. Using a group with fewer than 1,000 species can lead to inaccurate transition rate estimates and biased extinction projections.
*   **Pre-compiled Data**: For common taxonomic groups (like Carnivora or Mammalia), check the `data/precompiled/` directory in the source repository to save time and avoid API rate limits.
*   **Windows Usage**: If operating on Windows, always run commands through the **Anaconda Powershell Prompt** rather than the standard CMD to ensure environment paths are correctly resolved.
*   **Status Transitions**: Remember that the simulation is based on the *history* of status changes. If a group has very little historical data in the IUCN Red List, the simulation results will have higher uncertainty.
