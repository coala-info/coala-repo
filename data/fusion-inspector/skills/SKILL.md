# fusion-inspector

## Overview

FusionInspector is a specialized tool within the Trinity Cancer Transcriptome Analysis Toolkit (CTAT) designed to validate predicted fusion transcripts. Unlike discovery tools that search the entire transcriptome, FusionInspector performs a "supervised" analysis. It extracts genomic regions for specific fusion candidates, constructs "mini-fusion-contigs," and re-aligns the original RNA-Seq reads to these contigs. This approach allows for more sensitive recovery of evidence (spanning fragments and split reads) that might have been missed or misaligned during a genome-wide search. It is the standard tool for refining fusion calls and generating high-quality visualizations for publication or clinical review.

## Command Line Usage

### Basic Execution
The primary command requires a list of fusion candidates, a CTAT genome library, and the original FASTQ files.

```bash
FusionInspector --fusions candidate_fusions.txt \
                --genome_lib /path/to/CTAT_genome_lib \
                --left_fq rnaseq_1.fq \
                --right_fq rnaseq_2.fq \
                --out_dir output_directory \
                --out_prefix finspector \
                --vis
```

### Input Format
The `--fusions` file must contain candidate fusion pairs in the format `GeneA--GeneB`, one per line. If the file is a tab-delimited output from another tool (like STAR-Fusion), FusionInspector will typically parse the first column.

### Key Parameters
- `--genome_lib`: Path to the required CTAT genome resource library (e.g., GRCh38_gencode_vXX_CTAT_lib).
- `--vis`: Generates an interactive HTML-based fusion report for easy navigation of evidence.
- `--examine_coding_effect`: (Optional) Includes Trinity de novo assembly to reconstruct the fusion transcript and predict the protein-coding impact (e.g., in-frame vs. out-of-frame).

## Expert Tips and Best Practices

### 1. Distinguishing Artifacts from Real Fusions
FusionInspector classifies fusions as **COSMIC-like** or **Artifact-like**. 
- **COSMIC-like**: High expression, breakpoints at reference splice junctions, and high allelic ratios.
- **Artifact-like**: Often characterized by microhomologies at the breakpoint or low evidence relative to the expression of the unfused partner genes. Use the generated `fusion_inspector.fusion_predictions.tsv` to review these metrics.

### 2. Combining Multiple Prediction Lists
You can provide multiple candidate lists simultaneously by separating them with a comma:
`--fusions list_A.txt,list_B.txt`. FusionInspector will merge these and analyze the union of candidates.

### 3. Visualization Options
While the `--vis` flag produces a standalone HTML report (via igv-reports), you can also load the resulting `.bed` and `.gtf` files directly into the IGV desktop application for deeper manual inspection of read alignments against the mini-contigs.

### 4. Resource Requirements
Because FusionInspector aligns reads to a much smaller "mini-genome" (the fusion contigs), it is significantly faster and requires less RAM than initial discovery tools. However, if using the Trinity assembly option, ensure sufficient CPU cores are available for the assembly phase.
