name: bioconductor-ripat
description: RIPAT analyzes retroviral integration patterns by mapping sites to the human genome and calculating their proximity to genomic features. Use when user asks to map retroviral integration sites, annotate hits relative to genes or CpG islands, perform statistical comparisons against random integration sets, or visualize integration density on karyograms.

# bioconductor-ripat

## Overview
RIPAT (Retroviral Integration Pattern Analysis Tool) is an R package designed to analyze the distribution and biological significance of retroviral integration sites. It maps integration regions to the human genome and calculates distances to key genomic factors. The package supports comparative analysis against random integration sets to determine if observed patterns are statistically significant.

## Installation
Install the package using BiocManager:
```r
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("RIPAT")
library(RIPAT)
```

## Core Workflow

### 1. Data Preparation
Download required genomic data for the target organism (GRCh37 or GRCh38).
```r
# dataType can be 'gene', 'cpg', 'repeat', or 'pathogenic'
makeData(organism = 'GRCh37', dataType = 'gene')
```

### 2. Creating Input Objects
Convert local alignment results (BLAST output format 6 or BLAT) into a RIPAT-compatible R object.
```r
blast_obj = makeInputObj(inFile = 'blast_result.txt',
                         vectorPos = 'front', # 'front' or 'back'
                         mapTool = 'blast',
                         outPath = '.',
                         outFileName = 'my_analysis')
```

### 3. Annotation and Analysis
Annotate hits based on genomic features. The `annoByGene` function is the primary tool for gene and TSS (Transcription Start Site) proximity analysis.

```r
# Analysis with 10,000 random sites for statistical comparison
results = annoByGene(hits = blast_obj,
                     organism = 'GRCh37',
                     interval = 5000,
                     range = c(-20000, 20000),
                     doRandom = TRUE,
                     randomSize = 10000,
                     includeUndecided = FALSE,
                     outPath = '.',
                     outFileName = 'analysis_output')
```

### 4. Visualization and Reporting
Generate karyograms to visualize integration density across chromosomes and create summary documents.

```r
# Generate Karyogram
karyo_obj = drawingKaryo(hits = blast_obj,
                         organism = "GRCh37",
                         feature = results$Gene_data,
                         includeUndecided = FALSE,
                         outPath = getwd(),
                         outFileName = 'karyo_plot')

# Generate Excel reports and P-value plots
makeDocument(res = results,
             dataType = 'gene',
             excelOut = TRUE,
             includeUndecided = FALSE,
             outPath = getwd(),
             outFileName = 'final_report')
```

## Key Functions
- `makeData()`: Downloads necessary genomic databases (Ensembl, UCSC, ClinVar).
- `makeInputObj()`: Parses alignment files into the internal `hits` format.
- `annoByGene()`: Analyzes integration relative to genes and TSS.
- `annoByCpG()` / `annoByRepeat()` / `annoByPathogenic()`: Specialized annotation functions for other genomic features.
- `drawingKaryo()`: Plots integration sites on a genomic ideogram.
- `makeDocument()`: Summarizes results into tables and diagnostic plots (histograms and p-value dot plots).

## Usage Tips
- **Genome Versions**: RIPAT is specifically designed for human genome versions GRCh37 and GRCh38.
- **Random Analysis**: Always set `doRandom = TRUE` when you need to determine if the integration pattern is non-random (e.g., enrichment in specific gene regions).
- **P-Value Interpretation**: In `makeDocument` outputs, full-colored circles indicate significant differences (p <= 0.05) between experimental and random data.
- **Input Format**: Ensure BLAST results are generated with `-outfmt 6`.
