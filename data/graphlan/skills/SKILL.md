# graphlan

## Overview
GraPhlAn (Graphical Phylogenetic Analysis) is a visualization tool that transforms tree-like data into publication-ready circular figures. It excels at mapping metadata (such as abundance, phenotype, or clade-specific markers) onto the branches and rings of a phylogenetic tree. Use this skill to guide the multi-step process of converting raw tree files into annotated graphical outputs.

## Core Workflow
The standard GraPhlAn pipeline involves two primary command-line steps:

1. **Annotation Integration**: Use `graphlan_annotate.py` to merge the input tree with a text-based annotation file.
   - Input: A tree file (Newick format) and an annotation file.
   - Output: A `.xml` file (PhyloXML) containing both the structure and the visual metadata.
2. **Image Generation**: Use `graphlan.py` to render the final image.
   - Input: The `.xml` file generated in step 1.
   - Output: An image file (supports `.png`, `.pdf`, `.svg`, `.ps`, `.eps`).

## Command Line Usage
### Basic Execution
```bash
# Step 1: Annotate the tree
graphlan_annotate.py input_tree.txt output_tree.xml --annot annotation_file.txt

# Step 2: Render the image
graphlan.py output_tree.xml output_image.png --dpi 300 --size 7
```

### Key Parameters for graphlan.py
- `--dpi`: Sets the resolution for bitmap outputs (default is 72; use 300+ for publication).
- `--size`: Sets the size of the image in inches (default is 7.0).
- `--pad`: Adjusts the padding between the image and the borders.

## Annotation Best Practices
The power of GraPhlAn lies in the `annotation_file.txt`. This tab-separated file defines the visual style. Common patterns include:

- **Global Settings**: Define the overall look (e.g., `total_plotted_degrees`, `start_rotation`).
- **Clade-Specific Styles**: Target specific nodes or branches to change color, width, or label style.
- **Rings**: Add concentric rings outside the tree to represent metadata like abundance or presence/absence.
  - Use `ring_internal` to define the ring index.
  - Use `ring_width` and `ring_height` to control thickness.

## Expert Tips
- **Tree Formats**: While Newick is standard, ensure the tree is rooted appropriately before processing if the circular layout appears distorted.
- **Label Overlap**: If labels are overlapping, increase the `--size` parameter or adjust the `clade_separation` and `branch_bracket_depth` in the annotation file.
- **Vector Output**: Always prefer `.svg` or `.pdf` for final publications to ensure the tree remains crisp at any zoom level.
