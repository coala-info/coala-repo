description: The partCNV package provides a statistical framework for identifying aneuploid cells with local copy number alterations from single-cell RNA sequencing data using EM algorithms and Hidden Markov Models. Use when user asks to identify aneuploid cells in hematologic malignancies, detect local deletions or amplifications from scRNA-seq data, or classify cells based on cytogenetic priors.

# bioconductor-partcnv

## Overview
The `partCNV` package provides a statistical framework for identifying aneuploid cells with local copy number alterations (deletion or amplification) from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. It is specifically optimized for hematologic malignancies where neoplastic cells may closely resemble normal cells. The package offers two main approaches:
1. **partCNV**: Uses an EM algorithm with mixtures of Poisson distributions guided by cytogenetic priors.
2. **partCNVH**: Extends the model with a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for feature selection, useful for broad genomic regions where only a portion may be altered.

## Core Workflow

### 1. Data Preparation
The package accepts sparse matrices (dgCMatrix), Seurat objects, or SingleCellExperiment objects.

```r
library(partCNV)

# From Seurat
# Seurat_obj <- NormalizeData(Seurat_obj, normalization.method = "LogNormalize", scale.factor = 10000)
# counts <- Seurat_obj@assays$RNA@counts

# From SingleCellExperiment
# counts <- NormalizeCounts(sce_obj, scale_factor = 10000)
```

### 2. Define Cytogenetic Region
Identify the genomic coordinates for the known alteration using `GetCytoLocation`.

```r
# Example: Deletion on chromosome 20 q-arm
res <- GetCytoLocation(cyto_feature = "chr20(q11.1-q13.1)")
```

### 3. Pre-processing and Filtering
Subset the count matrix to the region of interest and filter low-expression cells.

```r
# qt_cutoff: filters cells expressing in less than (1 - qt_cutoff) cells.
# Increase qt_cutoff if the gene count in the region is small.
GEout <- GetExprCountCyto(
    cytoloc_output = res, 
    Counts = as.matrix(counts), 
    normalization = TRUE, 
    qt_cutoff = 0.99
)
```

### 4. Running the Models
Both functions require `cyto_type` ("del" or "amp") and `cyto_p` (the expected proportion of altered cells based on clinical cytogenetics).

**Standard EM Approach:**
```r
pcout <- partCNV(
    int_counts = GEout$ProcessedCount,
    cyto_type = "del",
    cyto_p = 0.40
)
# Returns a vector of labels: 1 (aneuploid), 0 (diploid)
```

**HMM-Integrated Approach (Feature Selection):**
```r
pcHout <- partCNVH(
    int_counts = GEout$ProcessedCount,
    cyto_type = "del",
    cyto_p = 0.40
)
# Returns a list; use pcHout$EMHMMlabel for the final classification
```

## Best Practices
- **Target Use Case**: Primarily designed for hematologic malignancies (MDS/AML). For solid tumors, consider `copyKAT` or `inferCNV`.
- **Complex Cytogenetics**: If a patient has multiple alterations (e.g., `+8` and `del(20q)`), run the tool iteratively. Identify one group of altered cells first, then subset or re-run to find the second alteration.
- **Cytogenetic Priors**: The `cyto_p` parameter is critical. It should reflect the percentage of metaphases showing the alteration in the clinical report (e.g., 5/20 metaphases = 0.25).
- **Visualization**: Integrate results back into Seurat metadata to visualize aneuploid vs. diploid clusters on UMAP/tSNE plots.
