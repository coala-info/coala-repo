# fgbio

## Overview
fgbio is a high-performance command-line suite designed for the rigorous processing of Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) data. It is particularly distinguished by its advanced handling of Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMIs) and duplex sequencing, allowing for the generation of high-fidelity consensus reads that reduce sequencing and PCR errors. Beyond UMI processing, it provides essential utilities for FASTQ-to-BAM conversion, adapter clipping, and genomic file metadata management.

## Core Execution Patterns

### Running fgbio
fgbio is a Java-based application. While it can be run via `java -jar fgbio.jar`, it is most commonly invoked as a standalone command when installed via Bioconda.

**Recommended Java Options:**
For memory-intensive tools (like consensus calling), provide sufficient heap space:
```bash
java -Xmx4g -XX:+AggressiveOpts -XX:+AggressiveHeap -jar fgbio.jar <ToolName> [args]
```

### Read Structures
Many fgbio tools (e.g., `FastqToBam`, `DemuxFastqs`) use a "Read Structure" string to define how bases in a FASTQ should be interpreted.
- `T`: Template bases (the actual genomic sequence)
- `B`: Sample Barcode bases
- `M`: Unique Molecular Index (UMI) bases
- `S`: Skipped bases
- `+`: All remaining bases (e.g., `150T` or `+T`)

**Example:** `8M142T` means the first 8 bases are a UMI and the remaining 142 are template.

## Common Workflows

### 1. UMI-Aware Consensus Calling
This is the primary use case for fgbio. The standard pipeline involves:
1. **FastqToBam**: Convert FASTQs to unmapped BAM (uBAM) while extracting UMIs into tags.
2. **GroupReadsByUmi**: Group reads that originated from the same molecule.
3. **CallMolecularConsensusReads**: Generate a single consensus read from each group.
4. **FilterConsensusReads**: Filter the resulting consensus reads based on quality and support.

```bash
# Grouping reads by UMI (requires coordinate-sorted BAM)
fgbio GroupReadsByUmi --input aligned.bam --output grouped.bam --strategy Adjacency --edits 1

# Generating consensus
fgbio CallMolecularConsensusReads --input grouped.bam --output consensus.bam --min-reads 3
```

### 2. Demultiplexing FASTQs
Use `DemuxFastqs` to split FASTQs based on sample barcodes. It supports complex read structures and provides metrics on barcode matching.

```bash
fgbio DemuxFastqs \
    --inputs r1.fq r2.fq \
    --read-structures 8B+T 8B+T \
    --metadata SampleSheet.csv \
    --output output_folder/
```

### 3. BAM Manipulation and QC
- **ClipBam**: Clips reads to remove adapter sequences or overlapping segments in pairs.
- **ErrorRateByReadPosition**: Provides a detailed breakdown of substitution errors, useful for identifying sequencing artifacts.
- **ZipperBams**: Merges an unmapped BAM (containing metadata/tags) with a mapped BAM (containing alignments).

## Expert Tips
- **Memory Management**: Tools like `SortBam` and `GroupReadsByUmi` are memory-intensive. Always monitor the `-Xmx` setting.
- **Validation**: Before logging issues, validate your BAM files using Picard's `ValidateSamFile`, as fgbio expects strictly formatted inputs.
- **Read Structure Validation**: Use the `+` operator for the last segment of a read structure to handle variable-length reads gracefully.
- **Thread Scaling**: For `DemuxFastqs`, performance gains typically plateau after 2-4 threads; adding more may not significantly decrease runtime.



## Subcommands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| fgbio CollectAlternateContigNames | Collates the alternate contig names from an NCBI assembly report. The input is to be the '*.assembly_report.txt' obtained from NCBI. The output will be a "sequence dictionary", which is a valid SAM file, containing the version header line and one line per contig. The primary contig name (i.e. '@SQ.SN') is specified with '--primary' option, while alternate names (i.e. aliases) are specified with the '--alternates' option. The 'Assigned-Molecule' column, if specified as an '--alternate', will only be used for sequences with 'Sequence-Role' 'assembled-molecule'. When updating an existing sequence dictionary with '--existing' the primary contig names must match. I.e. the contig name from the assembly report column specified by '--primary' must match the contig name in the existing sequence dictionary ('@SQ.SN'). All contigs in the existing sequence dictionary must be present in the assembly report. Furthermore, contigs in the assembly report not found in the sequence dictionary will be ignored. |
| fgbio DemuxFastqs | Performs sample demultiplexing on FASTQs. |
| fgbio ExtractBasecallingParamsForPicard | Extracts sample and library information from an sample sheet for a given lane. |
| fgbio ExtractIlluminaRunInfo | Extracts information about an Illumina sequencing run from the RunInfo.xml. |
| fgbio FastqToBam | Generates an unmapped BAM (or SAM or CRAM) file from fastq files. Takes in one or more fastq files (optionally gzipped), each representing a different sequencing read (e.g. R1, R2, I1 or I2) and can use a set of read structures to allocate bases in those reads to template reads, sample indices, unique molecular indices, cell barcodes, or to designate bases to be skipped over. |
| fgbio HardMaskFasta | Converts soft-masked sequence to hard-masked in a FASTA file. All lower case bases are converted to Ns, all other bases are left unchanged. Line lengths are also standardized to allow easy indexing with 'samtools faidx' |
| fgbio SortFastq | Sorts a FASTQ file. Sorts the records in a FASTQ file based on the lexicographic ordering of their read names. Input and output files can be either uncompressed or gzip-compressed. |
| fgbio SortSequenceDictionary | Sorts a sequence dictionary file in the order of another sequence dictionary. |
| fgbio TrimFastq | Trims reads in one or more line-matched fastq files to a specific read length. The individual fastq files are expected to have the same set of reads, as would be the case with an 'r1.fastq' and 'r2.fastq' file for the same sample. |
| fgbio UpdateFastaContigNames | Updates the sequence names in a FASTA. |
| fgbio UpdateIntervalListContigNames | Updates the sequence names in an Interval List file. |
