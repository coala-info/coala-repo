# bioconductor-confessdata

name: bioconductor-confessdata
description: Provides access to the example dataset for the CONFESS Bioconductor package. Use this skill when a user needs to load, inspect, or use the text-converted C01 image files (Fluidigm C1 system) required for demonstrating or testing the CONFESS image analysis pipeline.

# bioconductor-confessdata

## Overview
The `CONFESSdata` package is a data-only experiment package for Bioconductor. It contains text-converted C01 image files generated on the Fluidigm C1 system. These data are specifically formatted for use with the `CONFESS` package, which performs cell detection and signal quantification for single-cell fluorescence imaging.

The dataset consists of a list describing image paths and metadata (Brightfield, Channel 1, Channel 2, etc.) rather than the raw image binaries themselves, allowing for efficient testing of the CONFESS workflow.

## Loading and Using the Data

### Loading the Dataset
To use the data in an R session, load the library and use the `data()` function:

```r
library(CONFESSdata)
data("CONFESSdata")
```

### Data Structure
The loaded object `CONFESSdata` is a list of 6 elements. You can inspect its structure using:

```r
str(CONFESSdata)
```

The list contains the following components:
- `BF`: Character vector of Brightfield image file names/paths.
- `CH1`: Character vector of Channel 1 (e.g., Green filter) image file names/paths.
- `CH2`: Character vector of Channel 2 (e.g., Red filter) image file names/paths.
- `separator`: The character used to separate metadata in the filenames.
- `image.type`: The format/extension of the image files.
- `dateIndex`: Information regarding the date or batch index of the run.

### Typical Workflow Integration
This data is typically passed into the `readFiles` or `CONFESS` estimation functions. Because the package contains "text-converted" versions of images, it allows the `CONFESS` package to demonstrate its image processing algorithms without requiring massive image files.

Example of accessing specific paths:
```r
# View the first few Brightfield entries
head(CONFESSdata$BF)

# Check the image type
print(CONFESSdata$image.type)
```

## Tips
- **Dependency**: This package is a companion to the `CONFESS` package. If you are trying to perform actual image analysis, ensure `library(CONFESS)` is also loaded.
- **Data Source**: The data originates from RIKEN single-cell projects.
- **Pathing**: Note that the strings in the list refer to file identifiers used by the CONFESS processing engine to locate and parse image data.
