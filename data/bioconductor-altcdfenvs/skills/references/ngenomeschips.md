Alternative CDF environments for 2(or
more)-genomes chips

Introduction

Let’s start by loading the package:

> library(altcdfenvs)

The Plasmodium / Anopheles is taken as an example:

> library(plasmodiumanophelescdf)

One will adapt easily the code below for other chips.

How to build a CdfEnvAffy object from the cdfenv
package

The first step is to wrap the naked enviroment in the package plasmodiumanophelescdf
in an object:

> planocdf <- wrapCdfEnvAffy(plasmodiumanophelescdf, 712, 712, "plasmodiumanophelescdf")
> print(planocdf)

Instance of class CdfEnvAffy:

name
: plasmodiumanophelescdf
chip-type: plasmodiumanophelescdf
size
22769 probe set(s) defined.

: 712 x 712

The numbers 712 and 712 correspond to the dimension of the array. If you do not know
these numbers for your chip, the easiest (for the moment) is to read CEL data in an
AffyBatch and call the function print on this object.

How to create a CdfEnvAffy that is a subset of the 2-
genomes one

If the identifiers starting with ‘Pf’ correspond to plasmodium, it is an easy job to find
them:

> ids <- geneNames(planocdf)
> ids.pf <- ids[grep("^Pf", ids)]

Subsetting the CdfEnvAffy is also an easy task:

> ## subset the object to only keep probe sets of interest
> plcdf <- planocdf[ids.pf]
> print(plcdf)

Instance of class CdfEnvAffy:

: plasmodiumanophelescdf-subsetProbeSets

name
chip-type: plasmodiumanophelescdf
size
4514 probe set(s) defined.

: 712 x 712

However, this is not that simple:the environment created does not contain all
the probe set ids from Plasmodium. Unfortunately, one cannot rely on pattern
matching on the probe set id to find all the probe set ids associated with Plasmodium.
The list of plasmodium ids included in the package can let us build a Plasmodium-only
CdfEnvAffy (contributed by Zhining Wang).

> filename <- system.file("exampleData", "Plasmodium-Probeset-IDs.txt",
+
> ids.pf <- scan(file = filename, what = "")
> plcdf <- planocdf[ids.pf]
> print(plcdf)

package="altcdfenvs")

Instance of class CdfEnvAffy:

: plasmodiumanophelescdf-subsetProbeSets

name
chip-type: plasmodiumanophelescdf
size
5407 probe set(s) defined.

: 712 x 712

Before we eventually save our environment, we may want to give it an explicit name:

> plcdf@envName <- "Plasmodium ids only"
> print(plcdf)

Instance of class CdfEnvAffy:

: Plasmodium ids only

name
chip-type: plasmodiumanophelescdf
size
5407 probe set(s) defined.

: 712 x 712

Assign the new Cdf data to an AffyBatch

Handling of AffyCdfEnv directly in within an AffyBatch, or AffyBatch-like, structure is
being completed. . . in the meanwhile, the current mecanism for cdfenvs has to be used.

If your CEL files were read into an AffyBatch named abatch.

envplcdf <- as(plcdf, "environment")
abatch@cdfName <- "plcdf"

From now on, abatch will only consider Cdf information from plcdf. If you want to

save this further use, I would recommend to do:

save(abatch, plcdf, envplcdf, file="where/to/save.rda")
