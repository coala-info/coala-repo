## Overview
AutoGrid is a pre-processing tool essential for AutoDock-based molecular docking. It calculates the interaction energy between a probe atom and a macromolecule across a 3D grid. These pre-calculated "grid maps" allow the docking engine to rapidly evaluate energy potentials during a simulation without re-calculating pairwise atomic interactions at every step.

## Grid Parameter File (GPF) Setup
To run AutoGrid, you must define a `.gpf` file. Ensure the following components are correctly specified:

- **Macromolecule**: Define the target protein using the `receptor` keyword (e.g., `receptor protein.pdbqt`).
- **Grid Center**: Use `gridcenter` followed by X, Y, and Z coordinates. This should typically be the center of the known binding site.
- **Grid Points**: Define the number of points in each dimension using `npts`. These must be even integers (e.g., `60 60 60`). The actual number of points created is `npts + 1`.
- **Spacing**: Set the distance between grid points with `spacing` (default is usually `0.375` Å).
- **Atom Types**: List every atom type present in your ligand using `ligand_types` (e.g., `ligand_types C OA N HD`).

## Common CLI Patterns
Execute AutoGrid using the `-p` flag to specify the parameter file and the `-l` flag for logging:

```bash
# Standard execution
autogrid4 -p protein.gpf -l protein.glg
```

## Expert Tips
- **Map Consistency**: Ensure the atom types defined in your GPF exactly match the atom types in your ligand's PDBQT file. If a ligand contains an atom type not mapped by AutoGrid, the docking simulation will fail.
- **Box Size**: If the ligand is large or its binding orientation is unknown, increase `npts` rather than `spacing` to maintain resolution, but be mindful of the memory overhead.
- **Electrostatics**: AutoGrid calculates electrostatic maps based on the partial charges in the receptor PDBQT. Ensure your receptor has been properly prepared with Kollman or Gasteiger charges.
- **File Naming**: By default, AutoGrid appends the atom type to the map filename (e.g., `protein.C.map`). Keep your file prefixes consistent to simplify the subsequent AutoDock configuration.
