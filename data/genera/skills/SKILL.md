## Overview
GenEra (Genomic Evolutionary Rate Analysis) is a bioinformatics tool designed to identify gene-family founder events. It automates the process of searching for homologs across the NCBI NR database and mapping those results to the NCBI Taxonomy to determine when a gene family first appeared in a lineage. It is particularly useful for distinguishing between truly novel genes and those that appear novel due to rapid evolution (using abSENSE) or for refining gene ages using structural alignments (via Foldseek).

## Core CLI Usage

The GenEra suite consists of several specialized commands. The primary entry point is the `genEra` script.

### Primary Workflow
1. **Database Preparation**: Before running the analysis, ensure you have a local copy of the NCBI Taxonomy and the DIAMOND-indexed NR database.
2. **Basic Execution**: Run the main pipeline to assign phylostrata to your query species.
   ```bash
   genEra -q query_proteins.fasta -d nr.dmnd -t taxonomy_dir -o output_prefix
   ```

### Advanced Search Modes
* **Structural Alignment**: Use Foldseek to search against the AlphaFold DB for higher sensitivity in detecting distant homologs.
  ```bash
  genEra -q query_proteins.fasta -s alphafold_db ...
  ```
* **HMM Reassessment**: Use JackHMMER (via the `-j` flag) to perform a more sensitive but significantly slower reassessment of gene ages after the initial DIAMOND search.
* **Nucleotide Search**: If working with orphan genes that might be hidden in unannotated genomic data, use the MMseqs2 integration to search against nucleotide assemblies.

### Specialized Tools in the Suite
* `hmmEra`: Specifically for HMM-based homology detection.
* `Erassignment`: The module responsible for the final age assignment logic based on search results.
* `tree2ncbitax`: Utility for mapping custom phylogenetic trees to NCBI Taxonomy IDs.
* `FASTSTEP3R`: Implementation for specific evolutionary transition analysis.

## Best Practices and Expert Tips

### Performance Optimization
* **DIAMOND Sensitivity**: GenEra relies on DIAMOND. For standard runs, the default sensitivity is usually sufficient, but for "orphan" gene analysis, consider increasing DIAMOND sensitivity settings if the tool allows pass-through arguments.
* **Offline Mode**: As of v1.2.0, GenEra can run completely offline. Ensure all taxonomy dumps and databases are paths to local directories to avoid execution hangs caused by attempted network calls.

### Accuracy and Validation
* **Taxonomic Representativeness**: Always check the "taxonomic representativeness score" in the output. This score helps assess if a gene's assigned age is reliable or if it suffers from poor sampling in specific clades.
* **Handling Fast-Evolving Genes**: Use the `abSENSE` integration to calculate homology detection failure probabilities. This is critical for distinguishing "orphan" genes (which may just be fast-evolving) from true "founder" genes.
* **Infraspecies Analysis**: For strains or varieties without official NCBI Taxonomy IDs, use the infraspecies-level analysis features (requires `Phytools` and `OrthoFinder`).

### Common Pitfalls
* **Database Mismatches**: Ensure the NCBI Taxonomy dump version matches the version used to create the DIAMOND NR database to avoid "TaxID not found" errors.
* **Memory Management**: Running JackHMMER (`-j`) or Foldseek (`-s`) significantly increases the computational footprint. Ensure your environment has sufficient RAM and CPU cores allocated for these steps.
