MBASED algorithm

The package MBASED (Meta-analysis-Based Allele-Specific Expression Detection) imple-
ments an algorithm for identifying instances of allele-specific gene expression in RNA count
data.
In one-sample analyses, MBASED identifies within-sample deviations from the null
hypothesis of equal allele expression, while for two-sample analyses, significant differences
in allelic ratios between samples with the same haplotypes are detected. This means that
the comparison is meaningful for samples from the same individual, but not necessarily for
samples from different individuals. MBASED uses principles of meta-analysis to combine
information across loci within a single unit of expression (which we call aseID, e.g., a gene, a
transcript, or an individual SNV), without relying on a priori knowledge of phased haplotypes.
The informative loci are usually heterozygous SNVs, but could also be aggregations of SNVs
or other variants that have been resolved into the same haplotype.
In the extreme case of
complete phasing, loci could be genes themselves, and the approach presented here reduces
to a (beta-)binomial test of difference between reads mapping to different haplotypes. In the
following discussion, we will use ‘gene’ in place of aseID and ‘SNV’ in place of ‘locus’, as
these are the units we typically use in practice.

The details of the statistical approach implented by MBASED can be found in the accompa-
nying paper. Here we briefly mention a few items pertaining to the interpretation of MBASED
output.

1-Sample analysis
For each gene g with at least one expressed heterozygous locus, we test the null hypothe-
sis phap1,g = phap2,g = 0.5, where phap1,g and phap2,g denote the underlying fractions of
transcribed copies of gene g, specific to each haplotype. Note that we assume that gene
g is represented by exactly two, and not more, haplotypes. The alternative hypothesis is
phap1,g ̸= phap2,g. The beta-binomial statistical model used by MBASED is flexible and
allows ASE assessment in presence of pre-existing allelic bias (e.g., over-representation of ref-
erence allele-supporting reads due to enrichment protocols even in absence of any underlying
ASE) and overdispersion. We show examples of this flexibility below, and the user is referred
to the accompanying paper for the details of the algorithm used by MBASED. For each gene
g the output of MBASED includes

1. Estimate of the underlying RNA major haplotype (allele) frequency (majorAlleleFre

quency, MAF).

2. P-value for the test of null hypothesis of no ASE (pValueASE). Note that the null hy-
pothesis can be reparametrized in terms of major haplotype frequency as H0 : M AF >
0.5. The reported p-values are not adjusted for multiple hypothesis testing, and such
adjustment should be carried out by the user when looking for statistical significance
across multiple genes.

1.1

MBASED Overview

3. P-value for test of null hypothesis of no inter-SNV variability of ASE in the gene (only
for genes with > 1 tested SNVs, pValueHeterogeneity). Small p-values correspond to
significantly inconsistent ASE measurements at individual SNVs within a gene. If the
unit of expression is a gene with multiple transcript isoforms, the observed inconsitency
might indicate isoform-specific ASE. Alternatively, SNVs for such genes might exhibit
background variability of ASE measures in excess of what is specified by the user
(MBASED requires the user to specify the level of variability in the data, see below).

1.2

2-Sample analysis
For each gene g with at least one heterozygous locus expressed in both samples, we test
the null hypothesis phap1,g,sample1 = phap2,g,sample2 = phap,1, where phap1,g,sample1 and
phap1,g,sample1 denote the underlying fractions of transcribed copies of gene g, specific to
haplotype 1 in each sample. No requirement is imposed that phap1,g,sample1 = 0.5, since we
are interested in differences in ASE pattern between the two samples, not in whether they
both exhibit ASE. Just as in 1-sample analysis, we assume that gene g is represented by
exactly two, and not more, haplotypes, and we further require that these haplotypes be the
same in both samples. The alternative hypothesis is phap1,g,sample1 ̸= phap1,g,sample2. For
each gene g the output of MBASED includes

1. Estimate of underlying major haplotype frequency difference, phapmaj ,g,sample1−phapmaj ,g,sample2,

where hapmaj is the major of the two haplotypes in sample 1 (majorAlleleFrequen
cyDifference). This is our measure of between-sample allelic imblance (the 2-sample
ASE). Note that assignment of haplotypes to ‘major’ and ‘minor’ is based exclusively
on sample 1, since the 2-sample analysis is designed to look for ASE specific to sample
1. If ASE specific to sample 2 is of interest, the roles of the samples should be reversed.

2. P-value for the test of null hypothesis of no differential ASE (pValueASE). Analogous to
1-sample analysis, the reported p-values are not adjusted for multiple hypothesis testing,
and such adjustment should be carried out by the user when looking for statistical
significance across multiple genes.

3. P-value for test test of null hypothesis of no inter-SNV variability of ASE in the gene
(only for genes with > 1 tested SNVs, pValueHeterogeneity). Small p-values cor-
respond to significantly inconsistent 2-sample ASE measurements at individual SNVs
within a gene. If the unit of expression is a gene with multiple transcript isoforms, the
observed inconsitency might indicate isoform-specific allelic imbalance between the two
samples.

Caveat Emptor

MBASED operates on read counts from heterozygous expressed SNVs. The onus is on the
user to make sure that the supplied counts do in fact correspond to heterozygous SNVs.
Any read counts coming from a homozygous SNV will by definition result in the detection of
monoallelic expression. Further, it is up to the user to pre-filter SNVs for any known artifacts
that might give rise to spurious ASE calls.

The p-values returned by MBASED are not adjusted for multiple hypothesis testing, and it
is left to the user to choose the appropriate adjustment procedure and significance cutoff.

Further, to ensure the sufficient power for ASE detection, we strongly recommend that only
SNVs with sufficient read coverage be retained for the analysis. What constitutes ‘sufficient
coverage’ will depend on the multiple hypothesis testing adjustment procedure and cutoffs

2

MBASED Overview

chosen by the user to employ on the p-values reported by MBASED. In our work, we required
the depth of coverage of at least 10 reads, and higher cutoffs may be employed with more
deeply sequenced samples.

Finally, while MBASED is designed to detect instances of statistically significant ASE, it is
up to the user to decide what constitutes biologically significant ASE. Apropriate cutoffs on
the reported measures of ASE (majorAlleleFrequency in case of 1-sample analysis, majorAl
leleFrequencyDifference in case of 2-sample analysis) should then be employed to define
the set of ASE genes for follow-up.

MBASED allows the user to provide information about pre-existing allelic bias and extra-
binomial dispersion of read counts at individual loci (see examples later in the vignette), but
currently does not provide explicit functionality for estimating these quantities.

See the accompanying paper for further discussion of these and other issues.

Examples

ASE assessment is performed by function runMBASED(). Please check the help page for
a full list of arguments. Here we show some examples of its use. We start by discussing
simple examples of both 1-sample and 2-sample analyses, and then show some examples of
advanced usage, including adjusting for pre-existing allelic bias and extra-binomial dispersion
in the data.

3.1

Input/Output format

The input and output of runMBASED() function are RangedSummarizedExperiment objects,
defined in R package ’SummarizedExperiment’. Please see the RangedSummarizedExperiment
help page for details. Briefly, the input object has rows corresponding to individual SNVs
and columns corresponding to samples. In 1-sample analysis, there is a single column. In 2-
sample analysis, there are 2 columns, one for each sample, with first column corresponding to
‘sample1’ and second column corresponding to ‘sample2’ in the language of section 1.2. The
output is also a RangedSummarizedExperiment object, with rows corresponding to individual
aseIDs and a single column. MBASED output at the level of individual SNV is stored as
metadata on the output object. The examples below will illustrate the usage.

3.2

1-sample analysis
Suppose we are looking at 2 genes, one of which has 1 SNV and the other has 3 SNVs:

The output of runMBASED() is a RangedSummarizedExperiment object with 3 single-column
assay matrices. The rows of the matrices correspond to individual aseIDs, in our case ‘gene1’
and ‘gene2’. The matrices are majorAlleleFrequency (MBASED estimate of gene-level MAF),
pValueASE (the coresponding p-value), and pValueHeterogeneity (the inter-SNV variability
p-values). Note that heterogeneity p-value is NA for gene1, since this gene only has 1 tested
SNV. The metadata slot of the return object contains a single element, ‘locusSpecificResults’,
which is a RangedSummarizedExperiment object with information on MBASED results at the
level of individual SNV. The assay matrices specify whether at a given locus allele1 belongs
to the major (gene-level) haplotype (‘allele1IsMajor’), and what the allele frequency is at that
SNV of the allele belonging to the major (gene-level) haplotype (‘MAF’). Since assignment
of ’major’ status to a haplotypes is based on gene-wide information, there may be cases when
the locus-specific MAF (frequency of ‘major’ gene haplotype at the locus) is < 0.5, as is the
case for the second locus of gene2 in the previous example.

When true haplotypes are unknown, MBASED assigns alleles to ‘major’ and ‘minor’ haplo-
types based on observed read counts, assigning the allele with higher than expected (under
conditions of no ASE) read counts to the same ‘major’ haplotype. The following example
illustrates this approach using the same data as before, by setting argument ‘isPhased’ to
FALSE:

Note that the pseudo-phasing based‘major’ haplotype of gene2 consists of the reference allele
at SNV2 and alternative alleles at SNV1 and SNV3. Also note that by design, the gene-level
estimate of MAF for the multi-locus gene2 is higher in the case of unphased data (0.58 vs.
0.505) and the SNV-level estimates are all ≥ 0.5. We rely on properly calibrated p-values to
prevent these higher estimates from resulting in spurious ASE calls due to pseudo-phasing.
This is accomplished by employing simulations (argument numSim) to obtain an approximation
to null distribution of MAF estimates. We used 106 simulations in the previous example and
we recommend at least this many simulations in practice. If parallel architecture is available
(see argument BPPARAM and documentation for function bplapply in R package BiocParal
lel), it can be employed when many genes are tested simulatneously (parallelization is done
over genes (aseIDs), and not simulations).

To illustrate the need for simulations, we show how the results are affected by bias introduced
during the pseudo-phasing step:

We also note that for a single-locus gene1, the phasing plays no role, and the simulation-
based p-values are very close to each other (there’s some variability due to random nature
of simulations) and are approximately equal to the analytical p-value based on the binomial
test:

Finally, let’s consider a case of isoform-specific ASE. Suppose that the 3 SNVs in gene2
correspond to 3 different exons, and that 2 transcript isoforms of gene 2 exist: isoform1 uses
all 3 exons, and isoform2 uses only the last 2 exons. Further, let us assume that

• both isoforms are present in 50/50 ratio

• isoform1 shows no ASE

• isoform2 shows complete silencing of one of the alleles (monoallelic expression, an

extreme form of ASE).

Here is an example of data one could observe under this toy scenario:

Table 2: Example of isoform-specific ASE

Notice that SNV1 shows lower coverage than the other 2 SNVs, since it is only expressed by
isoform1. Also note that alternative allele at SNV2 and reference allele at SNV3 are silenced
in isoform2. Overall, each isoform is represented by approximately 50 reads at each SNV that
is a part of that isoform.

We see that MBASED reports major allele frequency of 0.675 for this gene. Since the true
MAF is 0.5 for isoform1 and 1.0 for isoform2, the reproted value represents an average of
sorts. The small value of heterogeneity p-value (0.003) indicates that there is strong evidence
that ASE estimates are inconsistent across individual SNVs and that the reported MAF value
might be misleading (it is an aggregate of isoform-specific values). Also note that the reported
ASE p-value is 0. In practice, given the restricitions imposed by the number of simulations,
. In this instance, we should interpret the outcome
this means that we estimate pASE ≤ 1
as p-value < 10−6.

MBASED Overview

>

Analogous to 1-sample analysis, the output of runMBASED() for 2-sample analysis is a Ranged-
SummarizedExperiment object with 3 single-column assay matrices. The matrices are are
similar to those in 1-sample case, except our measure of ASE is the difference in major allele
frequency between the two samples. For example, for a single-SNV gene1, this difference is
18+23 = 0.1165. Notice that which allele is ‘major’ and which is ‘minor’ is determined
25+20 − 18
entirely by read counts in the first sample (tumor, in this case).

25

We would like to emphasize that the 2-sample MBASED algorithm is designed to find in-
stances of sample1-specific ASE (whatever sample1 may be) and is not symmetric with
respect to the 2 samples. Therefore, if we were interested in cases of normal-specific ASE
(e.g., loss of imprinting in cancer), we would re-run MBASED using normal sample as sample1
and tumor sample as sample2. The following examples illustrate this important point.

Adjusting for pre-exiting allelic bias
In a given sample, MBASED models the detected haplotype 1 allele counts Xhap1,SN V at
each SNV within gene g as independent random variables with

Xhap1,SN V ∼ BetaBin(n = nSN V , µ = fhap1,SN V (phap1,g), ρ = ρSN V )

1

20

MBASED Overview

where

and

E(Xhap1,SN V ) = nµ

2

var(Xhap1,SN V ) = µ(1 − µ)ρn(n − 1 + f rac1ρ)
3
If dispersion parameter ρSN V = 0 (this is the default model assumed by MBASED), the
model reduces to the binomial model

Xhap1,SN V ∼ Bin(n = nSN V , p = fhap1,SN V (phap1,g))

4

We will now assume the no-overdispersion binomial model (4) and will describe extensions
to non-zero dispersions in the next section. By default, MBASED assumes that

fhap1,SN V (phap1,g) = phap1,g

5

In other words, the underlying frequency of observed haplotype 1-supporting reads is equal
to the frequency of haplotype 1 transcripts in the cell. In practice, this may not be the case.
For example, the sample might undergo some enrichment procedure that results in global
over-representation of reference allele-supporting reads. Or the aligner used to map reads to
reference genome might favor one or the other allele at some SNVs due to the presence of a
homologous region elsewhere in the genome. In such cases,

fhap1,SN V (phap1,g) ̸= phap1,g

6

We refer to the situation where one allele is favored over another in the read data, even
in absence of ASE, as ‘pre-existing allelic bias’. MBASED assumes that fhap1,SN V (phap1,g)
satisfies the following functional constraint:

fhap1,SN V (phap1,g) =

fhap1,SN V (0.5) × phap1,g
fhap1,SN V (0.5) × phap1,g + fhap2,SN V (0.5) × phap2,g

7

In words, fhap1,SN V (phap1,g) is proportional to both phap1,g and fhap1,SN V (0.5) (the under-
lying frequency of observed haplotype 1-supporting reads under conditions of no ASE) and
is uniquely determined by these two frequencies. MBASED adjusts its estimates of ASE and
corresponding statistical significance, when supplied with values of probabilities of observing
allele 1-supporting reads under conditions of no ASE, fhap1,SN V (0.5) in our notation. As an
example, consider a hypothetical case of known reference allele bias, where under conditions
of no ASE (phap1,g = phap2,g = 0.5) the frequency of observed reference allele-supporting
reads is 60% (fref,SN V (0.5) = 0.6 and falt,SN V (0.5) = 0.4) for all SNVs. Suppose we
observe the following read counts:

Table 4: Example of reference bias in the data

Notice that gene2 is exhibiting 60/40 ratio of reference to alternative allele read counts, which
is what we expect of genes with no ASE under the reference allele bias described above. In
contrast, gene1 shows overexpression of alternative allele, which may actually be seen as
evidence for ASE. MBASED allows one to specify the extent of pre-existing allelic bias by
providing a corresponding matrix in the assays of the input RangedSummarizedExperiment
object. By default, MBASED assumes that the background (no ASE) allelic ratio is 50/50:

Note that we labeled 3 out of 4 reference alleles as allele1 and the corresponding alternative
alleles as allele2 (the sole exception is SNV2 of gene2, where alternative allele is allele1). As
can be expected, not accounting for pre-existing alleic bias results in gene2 showing strong
evidence of ASE (p-value=0.04, all reference alleles are assigned to major haplotype). We
can fix the problem by changing the value of lociAllele1CountsNoASEProbs assay matrix to
the correct values of probabilites of observing allele1 under the conditions of no ASE:

Notice that the estimate of MAF for gene2 went down from 0.63 to 0.54, and the p-value
went up from 0.04 to 0.86. In contrast, MAF for gene1 went up from 0.56 to 0.66 and the
p-value dropped from 0.55 to 0.05 (as we are much less likely to observe overexpression of
alternative allele if the bias in the data favors the reference allele).

When 2-sample analysis is performed, the second column of lociAllele1CountsNoASEProbs
specifies no-ASE allelic probabilities for the same alleles in sample 2, (and thus MBASED
allows for possibility that pre-existing allelic biases are different in the two samples).

In our own work, we assumed that the no-ASE probability of observing reference allele-
supporting read was the same across all heterozygous loci within each sample (global ref-
erence bias) and estimated it for our data to be approximately 0.52 (see the accompanying
paper for the details of the estimation procedure). A better approach would be to estimate
this probability separately at each SNV based on a large number of samples known to not ex-
hibit ASE at that locus (and keeping the protocol/sequencing/alignment pipeline constant).
Currently MBASED provdies no functionality for estimating the extent of pre-existing allelic
bias and the user is advised to investigate their data prior to changing the default values of
the relevent function arguments.

3.5

Adjusting for overdispersion
By default, MBASED assumes that dispersion parameter ρ in model 1 is 0, leading to binomial
model 4. In practice, extra-binomial dispersion may be present in the sequencing read count
data and needs to be taken into account in order to assign proper statistical significance to
observed levels of ASE. Below we generate some counts from beta-binomial distribution and
show how model misspecification (assuming data to be binomial) affects ASE calling. We
use our earlier total read counts for single-SNV gene1 and 3-SNV gene2. We also use the
same value of overdispersion parameter ρ = 0.02 at each SNV.

We observe that after taking overdispersion into account, gene1 had its ASE p-value increase
from 0.55 to 0.67, and gene2 had the pvalue increase from 0.05 to 0.19. In practice, not taking
overdispersion into account leads to a number of false positive ASE calls, with the number
of false positives rising as the extent of overdispersion increases. Therefore it is important
to have a good grasp of how much dispersion is present in the data. Also note a slight
change in the estimate of major allele frequency for gene2, which results from incorporation
of extra-variability into the estimate during the meta-analytic integration of ASE information
from multiple SNVs within that gene.

When 2-sample analysis is performed, the second column of lociCountsDispersions specifies
dispersion parameter values for the same SNVs in sample 2, (and thus MBASED allows for
possibility that the extent of overdispersion is different in the two samples).

In our own work, we assumed that the dispersion was the same across all loci within each
sample and estimated it for our data to be approximately 0.004 (see the accompanying
paper for the details of the estimation procedure). A better approach would be to estimate
the dispersion separately at each SNV based on a large number of samples known to not
exhibit ASE at that locus (and keeping the protocol/sequencing/alignment pipeline constant).
Currently MBASED provdies no functionality for estimating the extent the dispersion and the
user is advised to investigate their data prior to changing the default values of the relevent
function arguments.
