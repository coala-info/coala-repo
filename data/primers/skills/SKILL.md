description: The primers tool designs and scores DNA primers optimized for assembly workflows by evaluating melting temperatures, GC content, and secondary structures. Use when user asks to design primers for DNA assembly, add 5' overhangs for Golden Gate or Gibson assembly, check for off-target binding, or score existing primer pairs.

# primers

## Overview
The `primers` tool is a streamlined CLI and Python library specifically engineered for DNA assembly. While general tools like Primer3 exist, `primers` is optimized for workflows where additional sequences must be added to the 5' ends of primers. It employs a linear penalty function to evaluate primer pairs based on their melting temperatures (both the annealing portion and the total sequence), GC ratios, and secondary structure stability (minimum free energy).

## Common CLI Patterns

### Basic Primer Design
To generate a standard pair of primers for a target sequence:
```bash
primers create CTACTAATAGCACACACGGGGACTAGCATCTATCTCAGCTACGATCAGCATC
```

### Adding 5' Overhangs (e.g., Golden Gate)
To add specific sequences like BsaI (`GGTCTC`) or BpiI (`GAAGAC`) recognition sites to the FWD and REV primers:
```bash
primers create -f GGTCTC -r GAAGAC [TARGET_SEQUENCE]
```

### Optimizing Homology Arm Length (e.g., Gibson Assembly)
If you have a long potential homology sequence but want the tool to choose the best subsequence (between 15 and 25 bp) to minimize penalties:
```bash
primers create -f [LONG_HOMOLOGY_SEQ] -fl 15 25 [TARGET_SEQUENCE]
```

### Off-target Binding Check
To ensure primers do not bind elsewhere in a larger context (like a backbone or genome), provide the background sequence with `-t`:
```bash
primers create -t [BACKGROUND_SEQUENCE] [TARGET_SEQUENCE]
```

### Scoring Existing Primers
To evaluate primers you already have against a template:
```bash
primers score [FWD_SEQ] [REV_SEQ] -s [TEMPLATE_SEQUENCE]
```

## Expert Tips and Best Practices

*   **Tm vs. Ttm**: Distinguish between `tm` (the melting temperature of the portion that binds to the template) and `ttm` (the total melting temperature including the 5' addition). Use `tm` for setting your initial PCR annealing temperature.
*   **Secondary Structure (dg)**: The `dg` value represents the minimum free energy of the secondary structure. Values closer to 0 are better; highly negative values indicate stable hairpins or dimers that may inhibit PCR.
*   **Penalty Scores**: The `p` column represents the total penalty. Lower scores indicate better primers. If scores are high, check the JSON output (`--json`) to see which specific constraint (Tm difference, GC ratio, etc.) is driving the penalty.
*   **JSON Integration**: Use the `--json` flag when you need to pipe results into other tools or scripts for automated assembly design. It provides a detailed breakdown of the scoring components (e.g., `penalty_tm_diff`, `penalty_dg`).
*   **Sequence Input**: Ensure sequences are provided in the 5' to 3' direction. The tool automatically handles the reverse complementation required for the REV primer.
