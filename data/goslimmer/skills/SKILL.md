```
## Overview
GOSlimmer is a tool designed to simplify Gene Ontology (GO) annotations by mapping them to a specified GO slim. This process reduces the granularity of GO terms, making large annotation datasets more manageable and interpretable for biological analysis. It's particularly useful when dealing with extensive gene annotations and needing to focus on broader functional categories.

## Usage Instructions

GOSlimmer operates by taking a full Gene Ontology file, a GO slim file, and an annotation file as input, and producing a slimmed annotation file as output.

### Input Requirements:

1.  **Full Gene Ontology File**: Can be in OBO or OWL format.
2.  **Slim Gene Ontology File**: Any version of GO slim, also in OBO or OWL format.
3.  **Annotation File**: Supported formats include:
    *   GAF (Gene Ontology Annotation File)
    *   BLAST2GO format
    *   Tabular format (gene IDs in the first column, GO term IDs in the second)

### Output:

*   **Slim Annotation File**: A tabular file listing non-redundant GO Slim annotations for gene products from the original annotation file.

### Command Line Usage (Conceptual):

While specific command-line syntax is not detailed in the provided documentation, the general workflow involves specifying the input files and the desired output. A typical invocation might look conceptually like this:

```bash
goslimmer --go-full <path/to/full_go.obo> --go-slim <path/to/go_slim.obo> --annotations <path/to/annotations.gaf> --output <path/to/slim_annotations.tsv>
```

**Note**: The exact command-line arguments and their order may vary. Refer to the tool's specific documentation or help output for precise syntax.

### Expert Tips:

*   **File Formats**: Ensure your input files are in the correct formats (OBO/OWL for GO files, GAF/BLAST2GO/tabular for annotations) to avoid processing errors.
*   **GO Slim Selection**: Choose a GO slim that aligns with the level of detail required for your analysis. A too-broad slim might obscure important distinctions, while a too-narrow one might not achieve sufficient simplification.
*   **Annotation File Structure**: For tabular annotation files, confirm that gene IDs are in the first column and GO term IDs are in the second.
