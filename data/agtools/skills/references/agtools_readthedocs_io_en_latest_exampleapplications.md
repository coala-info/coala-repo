# Example applications of *agtools*

## Bin contigs by connected components

Contigs of a genome ideally form connected components in the assembly graph. Here is a minimal, straightforward example using *agtools* that “bins” contigs by connected components (each bin = one connected component in the contig graph). It uses *agtools* to load a contig graph and then `get_connected_components()` to group contigs.

```
# 1) pick the assembler loader that matches your assembly
#    (metaSPAdes shown here)
from agtools.assemblers import spades

# --- files produced by your assembler ---
graph_file        = "ERR321017_assembly_graph.gfa"  # metaSPAdes GFA
contigs_fasta     = "ERR321017_contigs.fasta"       # metaSPAdes contigs
contig_paths_file = "ERR321017_contigs.paths"       # metaSPAdes contig paths

# 2) load the contig graph (ContigGraph)
cg = spades.get_contig_graph(graph_file, contigs_fasta, contig_paths_file)

# 3) compute connected components (bins) at contig level
components = cg.get_connected_components()   # list of lists of internal IDs

# 4) map internal IDs -> contig names and collect bins
#    (contig_names[i] gives the name for the internal ID i)
bins = []
for comp in components:
    if len(comp) > 1: # ignore isolated contigs
        bin_names = [cg.contig_names[i] for i in comp]
        bins.append(bin_names)

# 5) report / save
print(f"Found {len(bins)} bins")
for k, bin_names in enumerate(bins, start=1):
    print(f"Bin {k}  (n={len(bin_names)}): first few -> {bin_names[:5]}")

# Optional: write one TSV (bin_id, contig_name)
with open("contig_bins.tsv", "w") as out:
    out.write("bin_id\tcontig_name\n")
    for k, bin_names in enumerate(bins, start=1):
        for name in bin_names:
            out.write(f"{k}\t{name}\n")
```

Note

This example bins purely by graph connectivity (topology). If you want coverage and nucleotide composition-aware binning, you have to combine these bins with additional heuristics or downstream methods. Please take a look at [MetaCoAG](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-04749-7_5).

## Identify plasmid candidates

Here is a simple, example “plasmid candidate finder” using the *agtools* API. It flags circular contigs (self-loops) and reports their lengths. This is a good first pass before deeper validation.

```
from agtools.core.unitig_graph import UnitigGraph
from pathlib import Path

# --- input: unitig GFA from your assembler (SPAdes/Flye/etc.) ---
gfa_path = "ERR10750395_assembly_graph.gfa"

# 1) Load the unitig graph
ug = UnitigGraph.from_gfa(gfa_path)

# 2) Grab circular unitigs (self-loops) — these are strong plasmid candidates
circular_unitigs = ug.self_loops  # list of unitig names forming self-loops

# 3) Pull sequences, compute simple stats, and apply loose length filters
#    (plasmids are often a few kb to a few hundred kb; tweak as needed)
min_len = 1000
max_len = 500_000

candidates = []
for name in circular_unitigs:
    seq = ug.get_segment_sequence(ug.segment_names[name])
    length = len(seq)
    if min_len <= length <= max_len:
        candidates.append({
            "name": name,
            "length_bp": length,
        })

# 4) Print a quick report
print(f"Found {len(candidates)} circular unitig(s) in plausible plasmid size range [{min_len:,}-{max_len:,}] bp")
for i, rec in enumerate(sorted(candidates, key=lambda r: -r["length_bp"]), start=1):
    print(f"{i:2d}. {rec['name']}\tlen={rec['length_bp']:,} bp")

# 5) Optional: write results to a TSV
out = Path("plasmid_candidates.tsv")
with out.open("w") as fh:
    fh.write("unitig_name\tlength_bp\n")
    for rec in candidates:
        fh.write(f"{rec['name']}\t{rec['length_bp']}\n")
print(f"\nSaved: {out.resolve()}")
```

Note

Circular segments do not mean plasmids all the time. This example script is a first pass. For confirmation, you have to run gene/marker checks (replication proteins, MOB/relaxase, AMR markers) with downstream tools (e.g., PlasmidFinder or PLASMe) after you shortlist candidates from the graph.

## Identify bacteriophage candidates

Bacteriophages (or phages) with circular genomes tend to form circular components in the assembly graph. Here is a simple “phage candidate finder” using *agtools*. It looks for simple cycles in the oriented unitig graph (i.e., circular paths) and keeps the ones whose estimated genome length falls in a typical bacteriophage range (default 10–300 kb; most sequenced phages cluster around 30–50 kb). You can adjust `MIN_LEN`/`MAX_LEN` as needed.

```
import igraph as ig
from bidict import bidict

from agtools.core.unitig_graph import UnitigGraph

# --- input: unitig GFA from your assembler (SPAdes/Flye/etc.) ---
gfa_path = "ERR10359653_component_graph.gfa"

# size window for candidate phage genomes (kbp). Adjust as needed.
MIN_LEN = 10_000
MAX_LEN = 300_000

# 1) Load the unitig graph
ug = UnitigGraph.from_gfa(gfa_path)

# 2) Build an oriented (directed) version of the graph, as in the agtools example
#    Each segment gets a forward (+) and reverse (-) node; edges carry orientation.
oriented_nodes = bidict()
i = 0
for seg_name in ug.segment_names:   # internalID -> name mapping
    oriented_nodes[f"{seg_name}+"] = i
    oriented_nodes[f"{seg_name}-"] = i + 1
    i += 2

directed_ug = ig.Graph(directed=True)
directed_ug.add_vertices(len(oriented_nodes))

# label vertices with their oriented names for easy reading
oriented_nodes_rev = oriented_nodes.inverse
for vid in range(len(oriented_nodes)):
    directed_ug.vs[vid]["name"] = oriented_nodes_rev[vid]

# Oriented edges come from ug.oriented_links
edge_list = []
for from_id in ug.oriented_links:
    for to_id in ug.oriented_links[from_id]:
        for (from_or, to_or) in ug.oriented_links[from_id][to_id]:
            source = f"{ug.segment_names[from_id]}{from_or}"
            target = f"{ug.segment_names[to_id]}{to_or}"
            edge_list.append((source, target))
directed_ug.add_edges([(oriented_nodes[s], oriented_nodes[t]) for s, t in edge_list])

# 3) Enumerate simple cycles (each is a circular path with no repeated vertices)
cycles = directed_ug.simple_cycles()

def oriented_name_to_parts(oname):
    # "9001+" -> ("9001", "+")
    return oname[:-1], oname[-1]

def cycle_length_bp(cycle_vertices):
    # Sum unique segment lengths, minus overlaps along each oriented edge in the cycle
    oriented_names = [directed_ug.vs[v]["name"] for v in cycle_vertices]
    segs = []
    for on in oriented_names:
        sname, _ = oriented_name_to_parts(on)
        segs.append(sname)
    unique_seg_sum = sum(ug.segment_lengths[s] for s in set(segs))

    # sum overlaps along edges (wrap around end->start)
    overlap_sum = 0
    for a, b in zip(oriented_names, oriented_names[1:] + oriented_names[:1]):
        sa, oa = oriented_name_to_parts(a)
        sb, ob = oriented_name_to_parts(b)
        key = (ug.segment_name_to_id[sa], oa, ug.segment_name_to_id[sb], ob)
        overlap_sum += ug.link_overlap.get(key, 0)

    return max(0, unique_seg_sum - overlap_sum)

# 4) Score, filter, and lightly deduplicate cycles
seen_signatures = set()
candidates = []
for cyc in cycles:
    # signature: set of (segment names) ignoring orientation, to collapse reverse-complement/rotations
    oriented_names = [directed_ug.vs[v]["name"] for v in cyc]
    base_names = tuple(sorted({on[:-1] for on in oriented_names}))
    if base_names in seen_signatures:
        continue
    seen_signatures.add(base_names)

    L = cycle_length_bp(cyc)
    if MIN_LEN <= L <= MAX_LEN:
        candidates.append({
            "length_bp": L,
            "n_segments": len(base_names),
            "path_oriented": " -> ".join(oriented_names)
        })

# 5) Report
candidates.sort(key=lambda r: -r["length_bp"])
print(f"Phage-like circular candidates: {len(candidates)} (size window {MIN_LEN:,}-{MAX_LEN:,} bp)")
for i, rec in enumerate(candidates, 1):
    print(f"{i:2d}. ~{rec['length_bp']:,} bp  | segments: {rec['n_segments']}\n    {rec['path_oriented']}\n")

# Optional: write results to a TSV
out = Path("phage_like_candidates.tsv")
with out.open("w") as fh:
    fh.write("path_number\tlength_bp\tn_segments\tpath_oriented\n")
    for i, rec in enumerate(candidates, 1):
        fh.write(f"{i}\t{rec['length_bp']}\t{rec['n_segments']}\t{rec['path_oriented']}\n")
print(f"\nSaved: {out.resolve()}")
```

Note

This is a graph-only heuristic. Circular sequences do not mean they are always phages (could be plasmids, etc.). For biological confirmation, follow up with hallmark phage gene searches (terminase large subunit, capsid, portal, tail) using tools like [Pharokka](https://github.com/gbouras13/pharokka), [Phold](https://github.com/gbouras13/phold) and [Phynteny](https://github.com/susiegriggo/Phynteny_transformer) after shortlisting candidates. If you want to get both circular and linear phage genomes accurately, please check out [Phables](https://github.com/Vini2/phables).

## Haplotype phasing from assembly graph bubbles

Haplotype phasing aims to distinguish and reconstruct the individual haplotypes present in a diploid or polyploid genome. In assembly graphs, this can often be approached by identifying and resolving **bubbles** which are alternative paths in the graph that correspond to sequence differences between haplotypes.

Here’s a minimal local haplotype phasing example with graph-bubbles using the *agtools* API. It:

1. loads a `UnitigGraph` from a GFA,
2. builds the **oriented unitig graph** (the +/− version),
3. detects simple **bubbles** (two vertex-disjoint paths that split at a source and re-join at a sink), and
4. outputs the two **allele sequences** per bubble by stitching unitig sequences while subtracting per-edge overlaps.

```
