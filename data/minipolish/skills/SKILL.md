# minipolish

## Overview

Minipolish is a specialized wrapper designed to bridge the gap between the high-speed assembly of miniasm and the high-accuracy requirements of downstream analysis. While miniasm is exceptionally fast, its output consists of raw read segments with high error rates. Minipolish automates a multi-step polishing workflow using Racon to refine these assemblies. Crucially, it maintains the assembly in GFA (Graphical Fragment Assembly) format rather than converting to FASTA, preserving the connectivity information and adding metadata like read depth that is vital for visualization in tools like Bandage.

## Usage Patterns

### Basic Polishing
The standard workflow requires the original long reads (FASTQ/FASTA) and the miniasm GFA file.
```bash
minipolish -t 8 long_reads.fastq.gz assembly.gfa > polished.gfa
```

### Handling Different Sequencing Technologies
Adjust the alignment preset based on your input data type to ensure Racon and minimap2 use the correct parameters:
*   **ONT (Standard):** Uses `--minimap2-preset map-ont` (Default).
*   **ONT (Q20+):** Use `--minimap2-preset lr:hq`.
*   **PacBio HiFi/CCS:** Use `--minimap2-preset map-hifi`.
*   **PacBio CLR:** Use `--minimap2-preset map-pb`.

### All-in-One Assembly and Polishing
If starting from raw overlaps, use the included convenience script to run minimap2, miniasm, and minipolish in sequence:
```bash
miniasm_and_minipolish.sh long_reads.fastq.gz 16 > polished.gfa
```

## Expert Tips and Best Practices

### Circularization Logic
Minipolish is particularly effective for bacterial genomes because it handles circular contigs intelligently:
*   **Rotation:** It "rotates" the starting position of circular contigs between polishing rounds. This ensures that the "seam" where the sequence ends meet is polished as thoroughly as the rest of the contig.
*   **Link Repair:** It adds circularizing links to the GFA if they are missing, which improves visualization in Bandage.

### Understanding the Multi-Step Method
1.  **Initial Polish:** Minipolish first runs Racon on each contig independently using only the reads that miniasm used to build that specific contig (based on `a` lines in the GFA). This is extremely fast and brings identity to the high 90s.
2.  **Full Rounds:** It then performs global alignments (default: 2 rounds) to further refine the consensus.
3.  **Depth Calculation:** The final step calculates read depth and adds the `dp:f:` tag to the GFA `S` lines.

### CIGAR String Limitations
Be aware that while Minipolish updates the sequences, it does **not** recalculate the exact CIGAR strings for overlaps between linear contigs. The overlap values in the `L` lines will remain approximate based on the original miniasm assembly.

### Performance Tuning
*   **Threads:** Use the `-t` flag to match your available CPU cores. Polishing is computationally intensive.
*   **Rounds:** While 2 rounds are standard, you can increase this with `--rounds` if the assembly quality remains low, though returns usually diminish after 3-4 rounds.
