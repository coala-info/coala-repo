description: This genomics workflow processes Illumina sequencing reads using Meryl for k-mer counting and GenomeScope for statistical analysis of the resulting k-mer distribution. Use this skill when you need to estimate genome size, heterozygosity, and repetitiveness from raw sequencing data to assess the complexity of a genome before assembly.

# kmer-counting-meryl-upgraded

## Overview

This workflow performs k-mer counting and genomic profiling using Illumina sequencing data. It is designed to estimate fundamental genome characteristics—such as genome size, heterozygosity, and repeat content—starting from raw Illumina R1 reads.

The process begins by utilizing [Meryl](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/meryl/meryl/1.3+galaxy6) to construct a k-mer database from the input datasets. Once the database is established, the tool generates a k-mer frequency histogram, which serves as the primary input for downstream statistical analysis.

The resulting histogram is then processed by [GenomeScope](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/genomescope/genomescope/2.0+galaxy2) to model the genomic landscape. This step produces a comprehensive suite of outputs, including linear and log-scale plots, a summary of estimated genomic parameters, and a detailed model fit.

This workflow is licensed under GPL-3.0-or-later and is associated with the [Galaxy Training Network (GTN)](https://training.galaxyproject.org/), making it a standardized choice for researchers performing initial genome assembly assessments.

## Inputs and data preparation

| Step | Label | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Illumina reads R1 | data_input |  |


Ensure your Illumina R1 reads are provided in FASTQ format, as Meryl requires high-quality sequencing data to build accurate k-mer databases. While the workflow is configured for a single input, you can utilize dataset collections to process multiple libraries simultaneously. Consult the README.md for exhaustive documentation on parameter settings and expected output interpretations. For automated execution, consider using `planemo workflow_job_init` to create a `job.yml` file.

## How to run (Planemo)

### Local Galaxy (default engine)

```bash
planemo run galaxy-workflow-kmer-counting.ga job.yml --download_outputs --output_directory . --output_json output.json
```

Optional: `--galaxy_root /path/to/galaxy` speeds up spinning up a local Galaxy.

### Docker Galaxy

Append e.g. `--engine docker_galaxy --ignore_dependency_problems` (requires Docker).

### External Galaxy (usegalaxy.org / EU / …)

```bash
planemo run galaxy-workflow-kmer-counting.ga job.yml --engine external_galaxy --galaxy_url SERVER_URL --galaxy_user_key YOUR_API_KEY
```

Create a reusable profile: `planemo profile_create myprofile --galaxy_url ... --galaxy_user_key ... --engine external_galaxy` then `planemo run galaxy-workflow-kmer-counting.ga job.yml --profile myprofile`.

### Job file

- Generate a template: `planemo workflow_job_init galaxy-workflow-kmer-counting.ga -o job.yml`
- Lint: `planemo workflow_lint galaxy-workflow-kmer-counting.ga`

See **[Running Galaxy workflows](https://planemo.readthedocs.io/en/master/running.html)** in the Planemo documentation.

## Invocation outputs

After a successful run with `--download_outputs`, files appear under your chosen `--output_directory`. `--output_json` records CWL-style metadata for outputs (paths, checksums).

On an external Galaxy, use `planemo invocation_download INVOCATION_ID --profile ...` to fetch outputs, or track progress with `planemo workflow_track INVOCATION_ID`.

Workflow steps marked as **workflow outputs** in the editor are listed under **Workflow outputs**; exact filenames depend on tools and Galaxy configuration.
