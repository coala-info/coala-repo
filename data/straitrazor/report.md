### Original Help Text
```text
Not enough arguments!
Correct usage for version cstr8 v3.01
str8rzr -c configFile [OPTIONS] fastqfile1 [fastqfile2 ... ]
OR
str8rzr -c configFile [OPTIONS] < fastqfile1

IE, This program takes in standard input, or a bunch of (uncompressed) fastq files
And remember, options are specified *before* the configfile and fastqs (ie, the arguments)

Possible arguments:

	-h (help; causes this to be printed)
	-n (no reverse complement-- this turns off the default behavior of reverse-complementing matches on the negative strand)
	-v (verbose ; prints out additional diagnostic information)
	-i (Include anchors ; includes the Anchor sequences in the reported haplotypes)

	-a integer (default 1; the maximum Hamming distance used with anchor search. can only be 0, 1 or 2)
	-m integer (default 0; the maximum Hamming distance used with motif search. can only be 0 or 1)
	-c configFile (REQUIRED; the locus config file used to define the STRs)
	-p integer (The number of processors/cpus used)
	-t filter (This filters on Type, e.g. AUTOSOMES; ie, it restricts the output to STRs that have the same type as specified in column 2 of the config file)
	-o filename (This writes the output to filename, as opposed to standard out)
	-f integer (Min match; this causes haplotypes with less than f occurences to be omitted from the final output file
```
