name: uropa
description: UROPA annotates genomic peaks by linking them to biological features using complex, configurable logic beyond simple proximity. Use when user asks to annotate genomic peaks, filter annotations by feature attributes, apply directional or strand-specific logic, use specific anchor points like TSS or TES, or perform multi-step annotation.

# uropa

## Overview
UROPA (Universal RObust Peak Annotator) is a versatile command-line tool designed to bridge the gap between genomic coordinates (peaks) and biological features (genes, exons, etc.). Unlike simple proximity-based annotators, UROPA allows for complex filtering based on feature attributes, directional logic (upstream/downstream), and specific anchor points (TSS, TES, or center). Use this skill to guide the setup of robust annotation pipelines that require more than just "nearest gene" logic.

## CLI Usage and Best Practices

### Installation
The most reliable way to deploy UROPA is via Bioconda:
```bash
conda install -c bioconda uropa
```

### Core Command Structure
The primary execution pattern for UROPA involves passing a configuration file (typically JSON) that defines the annotation logic. While the tool is CLI-based, the complexity of the parameters (feature type, anchor, direction, strand) is managed through this configuration.

```bash
uropa -input <PEAKS_BED> -gtf <ANNOTATION_GTF> -config <CONFIG_JSON> [options]
```

### Key Parameters for Annotation Logic
When defining your annotation strategy, consider these four pillars supported by the tool:
- **Feature Type**: Specify which GTF features to consider (e.g., `gene`, `transcript`, `exon`, `CDS`).
- **Anchor**: Define the reference point on the feature for distance calculation (e.g., `start`, `end`, `center`, or `SS` for splice sites).
- **Direction**: Filter for peaks located `upstream`, `downstream`, or `internally` relative to the feature.
- **Strand**: Enforce strand-specific annotations (e.g., `same`, `opposite`, or `ignore`).

### Expert Tips
- **Attribute Filtering**: Leverage the ability to filter by GTF attributes. For example, you can restrict annotations to `protein_coding` genes or specific `gene_biotype` values directly within the tool's logic.
- **Multi-step Annotation**: UROPA can perform multiple annotation runs in a single execution by defining a list of "queries" in the configuration. This is useful for prioritizing certain features (e.g., "first look for TSS within 1kb, then look for any gene body within 5kb").
- **Output Interpretation**: UROPA generates a comprehensive table. Always check the `distance` and `relative_location` columns to validate that your directional logic (upstream/downstream) was applied as expected.
- **Resource Management**: For large peak sets or complex GTF files, ensure sufficient memory is allocated, as UROPA builds internal representations of the genomic features to speed up the search process.
