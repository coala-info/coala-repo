description: "This VGP workflow performs hybrid scaffolding of Hifiasm purged assemblies using Bionano optical maps and PacBio reads, utilizing the Bionano Hybrid Scaffold tool alongside BUSCO and QUAST for quality assessment. Use this skill when you need to increase the contiguity of a vertebrate genome assembly by integrating physical map data to bridge gaps and validate the structural integrity of your scaffolds."

# VGP hybrid scaffolding with Bionano optical maps

## Overview

This workflow is a specialized component of the [Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP)](https://vertebrategenomesproject.org/) assembly pipeline, designed to perform hybrid scaffolding. It integrates Bionano optical maps with sequence-based assemblies—typically those generated and purged via Hifiasm—to bridge gaps, orient contigs, and significantly increase the overall contiguity of the genome assembly.

The core process utilizes the [Bionano Hybrid Scaffold](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/bgruening/bionano_scaffold/bionano_scaffold/3.7.0+galaxy0) tool. It ingests the purged assembly, Bionano data, and estimated genome size parameters to identify overlaps and resolve structural conflicts. The workflow also incorporates PacBio trimmed reads and conflict resolution files to ensure the accuracy of the resulting scaffolds.

To ensure high-quality results, the workflow automatically evaluates the scaffolded output using standard genomic metrics. It runs [BUSCO](https://busco.ezlab.org/) to assess the completeness of conserved orthologous genes and [QUAST](https://quast.sourceforge.net/) to generate detailed assembly statistics. The final outputs include scaffolded sequences in AGP format, conflict reports, and comprehensive visual summaries of the assembly's quality.

## Inputs and data preparation

| Step | Label | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Hifiasm Purged Assembly | data_input | The assembly from "VGP-Hifiasm" workflow. |
| 1 | Bionano Data | data_input | Bionano data in Cmap format. |
| 2 | Estimated genome size - Parameter File | data_input | Parameter file generated in the VGP Hifiasm workflow. Estimated reference genome size (in bp) for computing NGx statistics |
| 3 | Is genome large (> 100 Mbp)? | parameter_input | Quast: Use optimal parameters for evaluation of large genomes. Affects speed and accuracy. In particular, imposes --eukaryote --min-contig 3000 --min-alignment 500 --extensive-mis-size 7000 (can be overridden manually with the corresponding options). In addition, this mode tries to identify misassemblies caused by transposable elements and exclude them from the number of misassemblies. (--large) |
| 4 | Conflict resolution files | data_input | Input a conflict resolution file indicating which NGS and BioNano conflicting contigs to be cut [optional] (-M) |
| 5 | Pacbio trimmed reads | data_collection_input |  |


Ensure your primary assembly is in FASTA format and the Bionano optical maps are provided as CMAP files, while PacBio trimmed reads should be organized into a data collection for efficient processing. Use the estimated genome size parameter file to calibrate the scaffolding tool, ensuring the large genome toggle is correctly set for assemblies exceeding 100 Mbp. For automated testing and job configuration, you can generate a template using `planemo workflow_job_init` to create a `job.yml` file. Refer to the `README.md` for comprehensive details on conflict resolution file formats and specific VGP pipeline requirements. One should always verify that the input assembly has been properly purged of haplotypic duplications to avoid chimeric scaffolds.

## How to run (Planemo)

### Local Galaxy (default engine)

```bash
planemo run bionano.ga job.yml --download_outputs --output_directory . --output_json output.json
```

Optional: `--galaxy_root /path/to/galaxy` speeds up spinning up a local Galaxy.

### Docker Galaxy

Append e.g. `--engine docker_galaxy --ignore_dependency_problems` (requires Docker).

### External Galaxy (usegalaxy.org / EU / …)

```bash
planemo run bionano.ga job.yml --engine external_galaxy --galaxy_url SERVER_URL --galaxy_user_key YOUR_API_KEY
```

Create a reusable profile: `planemo profile_create myprofile --galaxy_url ... --galaxy_user_key ... --engine external_galaxy` then `planemo run bionano.ga job.yml --profile myprofile`.

### Job file

- Generate a template: `planemo workflow_job_init bionano.ga -o job.yml`
- Lint: `planemo workflow_lint bionano.ga`

See **[Running Galaxy workflows](https://planemo.readthedocs.io/en/master/running.html)** in the Planemo documentation.

## Invocation outputs

After a successful run with `--download_outputs`, files appear under your chosen `--output_directory`. `--output_json` records CWL-style metadata for outputs (paths, checksums).

On an external Galaxy, use `planemo invocation_download INVOCATION_ID --profile ...` to fetch outputs, or track progress with `planemo workflow_track INVOCATION_ID`.

Workflow steps marked as **workflow outputs** in the editor are listed under **Workflow outputs**; exact filenames depend on tools and Galaxy configuration.

## Files

- `bionano.ga` — Galaxy workflow export (JSON)
- `job.yml` — inputs/parameters for `planemo run` (create with `planemo workflow_job_init`)
- [Planemo: Running Galaxy workflows](https://planemo.readthedocs.io/en/master/running.html)
