## Overview
FEELnc (FlExible Extraction of Long non-coding RNAs) is a specialized pipeline for identifying lncRNAs in transcriptomes reconstructed from RNA-seq data, with or without a reference genome. It provides a modular workflow to distinguish between new protein-coding isoforms and true non-coding transcripts, evaluate the likelihood of a sequence being non-coding, and provide functional context through genomic classification.

## Core Modules and Workflow

The pipeline consists of three primary modules that are typically executed in sequence.

### 1. Filtering Candidates (`FEELnc_filter.pl`)
This module removes spurious transcripts and those overlapping sense exons of reference protein-coding genes, which are likely just new mRNA isoforms.

*   **Basic Usage:**
    ```bash
    FEELnc_filter.pl -i transcripts.gtf -a reference_annotation.gtf -b transcript_biotype=protein_coding > candidates.gtf
    ```
*   **Best Practice:** Always use the `-b` (biotype) option to specify `protein_coding`. This prevents the tool from accidentally filtering out transcripts that overlap known lncRNAs or pseudogenes in your reference.
*   **Stranded Data:** If using a stranded protocol, you can include antisense monoexonic lncRNAs by adding `--monoex=-1`.

### 2. Coding Potential Calculation (`FEELnc_codpot.pl`)
This module computes a coding potential score for the filtered candidates. It uses a Random Forest model trained on k-mer frequencies.

*   **Basic Usage:**
    ```bash
    FEELnc_codpot.pl -i candidates.gtf -a reference_annotation.gtf -g genome.fa --mode=shuffle
    ```
*   **Modes:**
    *   `shuffle`: Recommended when you lack a high-quality non-coding training set; it generates a "null" set by shuffling the input.
    *   `intergenic`: Uses known lincRNAs as the non-coding training set.
*   **Performance Tip:** Use the `--proc` argument to specify the number of threads for faster k-mer counting.

### 3. Genomic Classification (`FEELnc_classifier.pl`)
This module categorizes lncRNAs based on their position relative to the nearest protein-coding genes.

*   **Basic Usage:**
    ```bash
    FEELnc_classifier.pl -i lncRNAs.gtf -a reference_annotation.gtf > classification.txt
    ```
*   **Output:** The resulting file provides the relationship (e.g., `lincRNA`, `antisense`, `intronic`) and the distance to the neighboring gene.

## Integrated Pipeline
For a standard run, use the provided wrapper script to execute all three steps at once:

```bash
FEELnc_pipeline.sh --candidate=transcripts.gtf --reference=annotation.gtf \
    --genome=genome.fa --outname=project_name --outdir=output_directory
```

## Expert Tips
*   **Input Preparation:** Ensure your reference annotation GTF contains `transcript_biotype` or `gene_biotype` attributes. If it doesn't, you may need to pre-process the file to add these tags or use a simplified GTF containing only protein-coding genes.
*   **Memory Management:** When working with large genomes, ensure the directory containing individual chromosome FASTA files is passed to the `-g` argument if a single large FASTA file causes memory issues.
*   **Environment Setup:** If installing via Git instead of Conda, you must export the `PERL5LIB` and `FEELNCPATH` variables to ensure the modules can locate the required libraries and binaries.
