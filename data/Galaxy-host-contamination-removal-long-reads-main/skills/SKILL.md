description: This workflow processes Nanopore fastq files by mapping them against a reference genome using Minimap2 and filtering out host or contaminant sequences with BAMtools and Samtools. Use this skill when you need to isolate microbiome sequences from long-read sequencing data by removing human or host DNA contamination to improve downstream analysis accuracy and speed.

# host-or-contamination-removal-on-long-reads

## Overview

This Galaxy workflow is designed to filter out host or contaminant sequences from long-read sequencing data, such as Nanopore or PacBio. Removing these sequences is a critical preprocessing step in microbiome analysis to improve computational efficiency and prevent host DNA/RNA from compromising downstream results.

The process begins by mapping input `fastqsanger` or `fastqsanger.gz` reads against a user-defined reference genome using [Minimap2](https://github.com/lh3/minimap2). The workflow then utilizes [BAMtools](https://github.com/pezmaster31/bamtools) and [Samtools](https://www.htslib.org/) to isolate and extract only the unmapped reads, which represent the microbiome sequences of interest.

To ensure data quality, the workflow generates comprehensive mapping statistics using [QualiMap](http://qualimap.genesilico.pl/). These statistics are aggregated into a final [MultiQC](https://multiqc.info/) report, providing a visual summary of the contamination levels and filtering efficiency across all samples.

This workflow is released under the MIT license and is tagged for microbiome and long-read analysis. For detailed information on input preparation and file structures, please refer to the README.md in the Files section.

## Inputs and data preparation

| Step | Label | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Host/Contaminant Reference Genome (long-reads) | parameter_input | Reads not mapping to this reference genome will be kept. |
| 1 | Long-reads | data_collection_input | Long-reads as a collection of fastqsanger(.gz) files |
| 2 | Profile of preset options for the mapping (long-read) | parameter_input | Each profile comes with the preconfigured settings mentioned in parentheses. You can customize each profile further in the indexing, mapping and alignment options sections below. If you do not select a profile here, the tool will use the per-parameter defaults listed in the below sections unless you customize them. |


Ensure your input long-reads are provided as a dataset collection in `fastqsanger` or `fastqsanger.gz` format to enable efficient batch processing. You must also provide a suitable reference genome for the host or contaminant and select the appropriate Minimap2 preset profile (e.g., map-ont) for your specific sequencing technology. For automated execution, you can initialize a job template using `planemo workflow_job_init` to generate a `job.yml` file. Refer to the `README.md` for comprehensive details on parameter selection and output interpretation.

## How to run (Planemo)

### Local Galaxy (default engine)

```bash
planemo run host-or-contamination-removal-on-long-reads.ga job.yml --download_outputs --output_directory . --output_json output.json
```

Optional: `--galaxy_root /path/to/galaxy` speeds up spinning up a local Galaxy.

### Docker Galaxy

Append e.g. `--engine docker_galaxy --ignore_dependency_problems` (requires Docker).

### External Galaxy (usegalaxy.org / EU / …)

```bash
planemo run host-or-contamination-removal-on-long-reads.ga job.yml --engine external_galaxy --galaxy_url SERVER_URL --galaxy_user_key YOUR_API_KEY
```

Create a reusable profile: `planemo profile_create myprofile --galaxy_url ... --galaxy_user_key ... --engine external_galaxy` then `planemo run host-or-contamination-removal-on-long-reads.ga job.yml --profile myprofile`.

### Job file

- Generate a template: `planemo workflow_job_init host-or-contamination-removal-on-long-reads.ga -o job.yml`
- Lint: `planemo workflow_lint host-or-contamination-removal-on-long-reads.ga`

See **[Running Galaxy workflows](https://planemo.readthedocs.io/en/master/running.html)** in the Planemo documentation.

## Invocation outputs

After a successful run with `--download_outputs`, files appear under your chosen `--output_directory`. `--output_json` records CWL-style metadata for outputs (paths, checksums).

On an external Galaxy, use `planemo invocation_download INVOCATION_ID --profile ...` to fetch outputs, or track progress with `planemo workflow_track INVOCATION_ID`.

Workflow steps marked as **workflow outputs** in the editor are listed under **Workflow outputs**; exact filenames depend on tools and Galaxy configuration.
