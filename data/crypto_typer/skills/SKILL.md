# crypto_typer

## Overview
The `crypto_typer` tool is a specialized bioinformatic pipeline designed to automate the identification and subtyping of *Cryptosporidium* species. It focuses on two primary loci: the 18S small subunit ribosomal RNA (for species identification) and the gp60 glycoprotein (for subtyping/branching within species). This tool is essential for researchers and public health officials tracking outbreaks or studying the genetic diversity of this parasite.

## Usage Guidelines

### Core Workflow
The tool typically processes raw or assembled sequence data to match against a curated database of *Cryptosporidium* sequences.

- **Species Identification**: Uses the 18S marker to distinguish between species such as *C. hominis*, *C. parvum*, and *C. meleagridis*.
- **Subtyping**: Uses the gp60 marker to identify subtype families (e.g., IIa, IId) and specific subtypes based on microsatellite repeats.

### Command Line Patterns
While specific flags may vary by version, the standard execution follows this pattern:

```bash
# Basic subtyping command
crypto_typer --input <sequences.fasta> --output <results_directory>
```

### Best Practices
- **Input Quality**: Ensure that input FASTA files contain high-quality reads or contigs covering the 18S and gp60 regions. Partial sequences may result in "undetermined" or broad-level classifications.
- **Database Updates**: Since *Cryptosporidium* nomenclature and known subtypes evolve, ensure the tool is pointing to the most recent internal reference database provided by the package.
- **Marker Selection**: If you only have data for one marker, the tool can still provide partial information (e.g., species-only from 18S), but both markers are required for a complete subtyping profile.
