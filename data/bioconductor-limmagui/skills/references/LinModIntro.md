1 Introduction

This document is intended to be only a very brief introduction to linear
models in microarrays. For more detailed information see the limma User’s
Guide https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/
limma/inst/doc/usersguide.pdf.

2 M and A

We will ﬁrst discuss M and A from the point of two-color cDNA microarrays,
in which one can talk about comparisons within a slide (between the two
colors) or comparisons between slides. Rather than representing microarray
data for a cDNA slide with raw Red and Green intensities, it is better to use
log intensities (base 2 is the standard base used for the logarithms). This
gives a more symmetrical distribution about the mean values of log2R and
log2G than you would get if you used R and G directly. Furthermore, we
are most interested in diﬀerences between R and G and overall intensities of
spots (the geometric mean of the Red and Green intensities), so we deﬁne
M , the log diﬀerential- expression ratio as M = log2(R/G) and A, the log
intensity as A = 1

2 log2(RG).

M = log2(R/G) = log2(R) − log2(G)

A =

1
2

log2(RG) =

1
2

(log2(R) + log2(G))

M can in fact be used to compare any pair of RNA types in the microarray
experiments, whether they are on the same slide or on diﬀerent slides. It is
still called the log diﬀerential-expression ratio.

3 Linear Models

To illustrate the simplest case of a linear model, consider two slides for
which the same hybridization has been performed for both slides with the
same dye colors. In this case, the best estimate for the M value for each
gene is simply the average of the two M values for that gene, one from each
slide. If a dye-swap was performed, then, one of the M values would have
to be multiplied by −1 before taking the average. The ﬁtted M values in
limmaGUI refer to the M values after the “averaging” has been done.

Things become more complicated when you want to estimate conﬁdence
in your average M values. The t statistic, B statistic and P value in the
toptables in limmaGUI are used to provide an overall ranking of genes in
order of evidence for diﬀerential expression. (By default, ranking is done
by the B statistic.) In order to calculate these statistics, limmaGUI must
consider all replicates of each gene (whether on the same slide or diﬀerent
slides) and consider the variation in M values as well as the magnitude of
the M values to decide which genes are diﬀerentially expressed. If you just
use M (the log diﬀerential-expression ratio) to rank genes from a microarray
experiment, then you are ignoring all of the information about variability
between replicates.

As well as using a linear model to estimate “average” M values, it is
also possible to estimate M values for comparisons which were not directly
performed in the experiment. If A is hybridized with B and B is hybridized
with C, then you can estimate two M values with a linear model. One
possible choice is to estimate M for the comparison (A,B) and estimate
M for the comparison (B,C). But it would also be possible to estimate M
for comparison (A,B) and M for comparison (A,C), even though there was
no direct hybridization between A and C. In limmaGUI, this is known as
choosing a parameterization. A parameterization can be speciﬁed in terms of
simple comparisons between RNA types, e.g. (A,B) and (A,C), or for people
with a bit of statistical experience, the parameterization can be speciﬁed in
terms of a design matrix (by pressing an “Advanced” button.) The columns
of the design matrix represent the parameters to be estimated by the linear
model (e.g. M values for comparisons (A,B) and (A,C)) and the rows of
the design matrix are the slides in the experiment. For the simple averaging
scenario described at the beginning of this section, the design matrix would
simply be a column of two 1’s. If there was a dye-swap, then one of the 1’s
would become a -1. In limmaGUI you can try specifying a parameterization
in the simple way (comparisons between pairs of RNA types) and then press
the “Advanced” button to see what the corresponding design matrix looks
like.
