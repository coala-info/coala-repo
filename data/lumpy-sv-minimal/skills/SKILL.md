# lumpy-sv-minimal

## Overview

LUMPY is a comprehensive discovery framework that utilizes a probabilistic approach to identify structural variants by integrating various evidence types from high-throughput sequencing data. This skill focuses on the core executables provided in the minimal package, primarily `lumpy` and `lumpyexpress`. While `lumpyexpress` serves as an automated wrapper that follows best practices for standard analyses, the traditional `lumpy` command allows for granular control over probability curves and evidence weights, making it suitable for complex experimental designs or non-standard library preparations.

## Core Workflows

### 1. Automated Analysis with lumpyexpress
For most standard SV discovery tasks, use `lumpyexpress`. It automates the extraction of signals and the generation of probability curves.

**Basic Usage:**
```bash
lumpyexpress \
    -B input.bam \
    -S input.splitters.bam \
    -D input.discordants.bam \
    -o output.vcf
```

**Joint Multi-Sample Analysis:**
To call variants across multiple samples simultaneously, provide comma-separated lists:
```bash
lumpyexpress \
    -B sample1.bam,sample2.bam \
    -S sample1.splitters.bam,sample2.splitters.bam \
    -D sample1.discordants.bam,sample2.discordants.bam \
    -o cohort_output.vcf
```

### 2. Traditional LUMPY Usage
Use the traditional CLI when you need to manually define library parameters or work with specific read groups.

**Key Parameters:**
- `-pe`: Define paired-end library parameters (mean, stdev, read_length, etc.).
- `-sr`: Define split-read parameters.
- `-g`: Genome file (defines chromosome order).
- `-x`: BED file of regions to exclude (e.g., high-coverage or centromeric regions).

**Example Command:**
```bash
lumpy \
    -mw 4 \
    -tt 0 \
    -pe id:sample_id,bam_file:sample.discordants.bam,histo_file:sample.lib1.histo,mean:300,stdev:50,read_length:101,min_non_overlap:101,discordant_z:3,back_distance:10,weight:1 \
    -sr id:sample_id,bam_file:sample.splitters.bam,back_distance:10,weight:1 \
    > output.vcf
```

## Expert Tips and Best Practices

### Pre-processing Requirements
- **Alignment**: LUMPY expects BWA-MEM aligned files.
- **Sorting**: All input BAM files must be coordinate-sorted.
- **Extraction**: If not using `lumpyexpress` to handle extraction, use `samblaster` or `samtools` to pre-extract discordant and split-reads.
  - Discordants: `samtools view -b -F 1294 sample.bam`
  - Splitters: Use the `extractSplitReads_BwaMem` script provided in the LUMPY repository.

### CRAM Support
- `lumpyexpress` can accept CRAM files for the main alignment input (`-B`).
- **Limitation**: The splitters (`-S`) and discordants (`-D`) must still be in BAM format, as the core LUMPY engine does not natively support CRAM for these specific evidence streams.

### Optimization
- **Exclude Regions**: Always use an exclude file (`-x`) for human data (e.g., ENCODE blacklist) to reduce false positives and significantly decrease runtime.
- **Smoove**: For production environments, consider using `smoove`, which wraps LUMPY and handles many of these best practices (extraction, genotyping, and filtering) automatically.

### Troubleshooting
- **Config File**: `lumpyexpress` relies on `lumpyexpress.config`. Ensure this file is in the same directory as the executable or specify it manually with `-K`.
- **Temp Directory**: SV discovery generates large temporary files. Use `-T` to point to a high-capacity scratch disk if the default `/tmp` is limited.
