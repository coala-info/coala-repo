Overview:

`grepq` searches the sequence line of FASTQ records for regular
expressions that are contained in a text or JSON file, or it searches for the
absence of those regular expressions when used with the `inverted` command. The 
FASTQ file on which it operates can be supplied uncompressed or in gzip or zstd
compressed format. Use the `tune` or `summarise` command in a simple shell script
to update the number and order of regex patterns in your pattern file according
to their matched frequency (refer to the examples directory of the `grepq` GitHub
repository, https://github.com/Rbfinch/grepq), further targeting and speeding up
the filtering process.

Examples:

Print only the matching sequences
    grepq regex.txt file.fastq

Print the matching sequences with the record ID
    grepq -I regex.txt file.fastq

Print the matching sequences in FASTA format
    grepq -F regex.txt file.fastq

Print the matching sequences in FASTQ format
    grepq -R regex.txt file.fastq

Save the matching sequences in gzip compressed FASTQ format
    grepq -R --write-gzip regex.txt file.fastq > output.fastq.gz

Read the FASTQ file in gzip compressed format
    grepq --read-gzip regex.txt file.fastq.gz

Read and save the output in gzip compressed format, with fast compression
    grepq --read-gzip --write-gzip --fast regex.txt file.fastq.gz > output.fastq.gz

Read and save the output in gzip compressed format, with best compression
    grepq --read-gzip --write-gzip --best regex.txt file.fastq.gz > output.fastq.gz

Read and save the output in zstd compressed format, with best compression
    grepq --read-zstd --write-zstd --best regex.txt file.fastq.zst > output.fastq.zst

Count the number of matching FASTQ records
    grepq -c regex.txt file.fastq

For each matched pattern in a search of no more than 100000 matches, print the
    pattern and the number of matches
    grepq regex.txt file.fastq tune -n 100000 -c

For each matched pattern in a search of no more than 100000 matches of a
    gzip-compressed FASTQ file, print the pattern and the number of matches
    grepq --read-gzip regex.txt file.fastq.gz tune -n 100000 -c

For each matched pattern in a search of no more than 100000 matches of a
gzip-compressed FASTQ file, print the pattern and the number of matches to a 
JSON file called matches.json
    grepq --read-gzip regex.json file.fastq.gz tune -n 100000 -c --names --json-matches

As above, but uses the summarise command to ensure that all FASTQ records are processed
    grepq --read-gzip regex.json file.fastq.gz summarise -c --names --json-matches

For each matched pattern in a search of no more than 100000 matches of a
gzip-compressed FASTQ file, print the pattern and the number of matches to a 
JSON file called matches.json, and include the top three most frequent variants of
each pattern, and their respective counts
    grepq --read-gzip regex.json file.fastq.gz tune -n 100000 -c --names --json-matches --variants 3

As above, but uses the summarise command to ensure that all FASTQ records are processed
    grepq --read-gzip regex.json file.fastq.gz summarise -c --names --json-matches --variants 3

For each matched pattern in a search of no more than 100000 matches of a
gzip-compressed FASTQ file, print the pattern and the number of matches to a JSON
file called matches.json, and include all variants of each pattern, and their
respective counts. Note that the `--variants` argument is not given when `--all`
is specified.
    grepq --read-gzip regex.json file.fastq.gz tune -n 100000 -c --names --json-matches --all

As above, but uses the summarise command to ensure that all FASTQ records are processed
    grepq --read-gzip regex.json file.fastq.gz summarise -c --names --json-matches --all

Print the records where none of the regex patterns are found
    grepq regex.txt file.fastq inverted

Print the records where none of the regex patterns are found, with the record ID
    grepq -I regex.txt file.fastq inverted

Print the records where none of the regex patterns are found, in FASTQ format
    grepq -R regex.txt file.fastq inverted

Count the number of records where none of the regex patterns are found
    grepq -c regex.txt file.fastq inverted

Count the total number of records in the FASTQ file using an empty pattern file
    grepq -c empty.txt file.fastq inverted

For a gzip-compressed FASTQ file, bucket matched sequences into separate files
named after each regexName, with the output in FASTQ format
    grepq -R --bucket --read-gzip regex.json file.fastq.gz

For a gzip-compressed FASTQ file, bucket matched sequences into separate files
named after each regexName, with the output in FASTQ format, and write a SQLite database file,
limiting the number of tetranucleotides in the TNF field to two
    grepq -R --read-gzip --writeSQL -N 2 --bucket regex.json file.fastq.gz

Tips:

1. Predicates can be used to filter on the header field (= record ID line)
using a regex, minimum sequence length, and minimum average quality score
(supports Phred+33 and Phred+64). Predicates are specified in a JSON pattern file.
For an example, see regex-and-predicates.json in the examples directory of the
`grepq` GitHub repository (https://github.com/Rbfinch/grepq). Note that regex 
supplied to filter on the header field is first passed as a string to the regex
engine, and then the regex engine is used to match the header field. If you get
an error message, be sure to escape any special characters in the regex pattern.

2. Use the `tune` or `summarise` command (`grepq tune -h` and `grepq summarise -h`
for instructions) in a simple shell script to update the number and order of regex
patterns in your pattern file according to their matched frequency, further targeting
and speeding up the filtering process. When the patterns file is given in JSON 
format, then specifying the `-c`, `--names`, `--json-matches` and `--variants` 
options to the `tune` or `summarise` command will output the matched pattern 
variants and their corresponding counts in JSON format to a file called `matches.json`,
allowing named regex sets, named regex patterns, and named and unnamed variants.
See 16S-no-iupac.txt, 16S-iupac.json, 16S-no-iupac.json and 16S-no-iupac.json for
examples of JSON pattern files, and matches.json for an example of the output of
the `tune` or `summarise` command in JSON format (example files are located in the
examples directory of the `grepq` GitHub repository: https://github.com/Rbfinch/grepq)
(see also the Examples and Notes sections). To list all variants of a pattern, use
the `--all` option. Note that the `--variants` argument is not given when `--all`
is specified.

3. Use the `inverted` command to identify records that do not match any of the
regex patterns in your pattern file.

4. Ensure you have enough storage space for output files.

Notes:

1. `grepq` can output to several formats, including those that are
gzip or zstd compressed. `grepq`, however, will only accept a FASTQ file or a 
compressed (gzip or zstd) FASTQ file as the sequence data file. If you get an
error message, check that the input data file is a FASTQ file or a gzip or zstd
compressed FASTQ file, and that you have specified the correct file format 
(--read-gzip or --read-zstd for FASTQ files compressed by gzip and zstd,
respectively), and file path.

2. Other than when the `inverted` command is given, output to a SQLite database
is supported with the `writeSQL` option. The SQLite database will contain a table
called `fastq_data` with the following fields: the fastq record (header, sequence
and quality fields), length of the sequence field (length), percent GC content (GC),
percent GC content as an integer (GC_int), number of unique tetranucleotides in the
sequence (nTN), percent tetranucleotide frequency within the sequence (TNF), and
a JSON array containing the matched regex patterns, the matches and their position(s)
in the FASTQ sequence (variants). If the pattern file was given in JSON format and
contained a non-null qualityEncoding field, then the average quality score for the
sequence field (average_quality) will also be written. The `--num-tetranucleotides`
option can be used to limit the number of tetranucleotides written to the TNF field
of the fastq_data SQLite table, these being the most or equal most frequent
tetranucleotides in the sequence field of the matched FASTQ records. A summary of
the invoked query (pattern and data files) is written to a second table called
`query`.

3. Pattern files must contain one regex pattern per line or be given in JSON
format, and patterns are case-sensitive (you can supply an empty pattern file to
count the total number of records in the FASTQ file). The regex patterns should
only include the DNA sequence characters (A, C, G, T), or IUPAC ambiguity codes
(N, R, Y, ...). See 16S-no-iupac.txt, 16S-iupac.json and  
16S-iupac-and-predicates.json in the examples directory of the `grepq` GitHub
repository (https://github.com/Rbfinch/grepq) for examples of valid pattern files.
Regex patterns to match the header field (= record ID line) must comply with the
Rust regex library syntax (<https://docs.rs/regex/latest/regex/#syntax>). If you
get an error message, be sure to escape any special characters in the regex 
pattern.

4. When no options are provided, only the matching sequences are printed.

5. Only one of the -I, -F, -R, or -c options can be used at a time.

6. The --read-gzip [--read-zstd] and --write-gzip [--write-zstd] options can be
used separately, or together, and in combination with any of the other filtering
options (the --write-gzip [--write-zstd] option cannot be used with the `tune` 
or `summarise` command).

7. The count option (-c) will support the output of the -R option since it is in
FASTQ format.

8. Other than when the `tune` or `summarise` command is run, a FASTQ record is
deemed to match (and hence provided in the output) when any of the regex patterns
in the pattern file match the sequence field of the FASTQ record.
        
9. When the count option (-c) is given with the `tune` or `summarise` command,
`grepq` will count the number of FASTQ records containing a sequence that is 
matched, for each matching regex in the pattern file. If, however, there are 
multiple occurrences of a given regex within a FASTQ record sequence field, `grepq`
will count this as one match. To ensure all records are processed, use the 
`summarise` command instead of the `tune` command.

10. When the count option (-c) is not given as part of the `tune` or `summarise`
command, `grepq` prints the total number of matching FASTQ records for the set
of regex patterns in the pattern file.

11. Regex patterns with look-around and backreferences are not supported.

compressed (gzip or zstd) FASTQ file as the sequence data file. If you get an
error message, check that the input data file is a FASTQ file or a gzip or zstd
compressed FASTQ file, and that you have specified the correct file format 
(--read-gzip or --read-zstd for FASTQ files compressed by gzip and zstd,
respectively), and file path.

2. Other than when the `inverted` command is given, output to a SQLite database
is supported with the `writeSQL` option. The SQLite database will contain a table
called `fastq_data` with the following fields: the fastq record (header, sequence
and quality fields), length of the sequence field (length), percent GC content (GC),
percent GC content as an integer (GC_int), number of unique tetranucleotides in the
sequence (nTN), percent tetranucleotide frequency within the sequence (TNF), and
a JSON array containing the matched regex patterns, the matches and their position(s)
in the FASTQ sequence (variants). If the pattern file was given in JSON format and
contained a non-null qualityEncoding field, then the average quality score for the
sequence field (average_quality) will also be written. The `--num-tetranucleotides`
option can be used to limit the number of tetranucleotides written to the TNF field
of the fastq_data SQLite table, these being the most or equal most frequent
tetranucleotides in the sequence field of the matched FASTQ records. A summary of
the invoked query (pattern and data files) is written to a second table called
`query`.

3. Pattern files must contain one regex pattern per line or be given in JSON
format, and patterns are case-sensitive (you can supply an empty pattern file to
count the total number of records in the FASTQ file). The regex patterns should
only include the DNA sequence characters (A, C, G, T), or IUPAC ambiguity codes
(N, R, Y, ...). See 16S-no-iupac.txt, 16S-iupac.json and  
16S-iupac-and-predicates.json in the examples directory of the `grepq` GitHub
repository (https://github.com/Rbfinch/grepq) for examples of valid pattern files.
Regex patterns to match the header field (= record ID line) must comply with the
Rust regex library syntax (<https://docs.rs/regex/latest/regex/#syntax>). If you
get an error message, be sure to escape any special characters in the regex 
pattern.

4. When no options are provided, only the matching sequences are printed.

5. Only one of the -I, -F, -R, or -c options can be used at a time.

6. The --read-gzip [--read-zstd] and --write-gzip [--write-zstd] options can be
used separately, or together, and in combination with any of the other filtering
options (the --write-gzip [--write-zstd] option cannot be used with the `tune` 
or `summarise` command).

7. The count option (-c) will support the output of the -R option since it is in
FASTQ format.

8. Other than when the `tune` or `summarise` command is run, a FASTQ record is
deemed to match (and hence provided in the output) when any of the regex patterns
in the pattern file match the sequence field of the FASTQ record.
        
9. When the count option (-c) is given with the `tune` or `summarise` command,
`grepq` will count the number of FASTQ records containing a sequence that is 
matched, for each matching regex in the pattern file. If, however, there are 
multiple occurrences of a given regex within a FASTQ record sequence field, `grepq`
will count this as one match. To ensure all records are processed, use the 
`summarise` command instead of the `tune` command.

10. When the count option (-c) is not given as part of the `tune` or `summarise`
command, `grepq` prints the total number of matching FASTQ records for the set
of regex patterns in the pattern file.

11. Regex patterns with look-around and backreferences are not supported.

Overview:

`grepq` searches the sequence line of FASTQ records for regular
expressions that are contained in a text or JSON file, or it searches for the
absence of those regular expressions when used with the `inverted` command. The 
FASTQ file on which it operates can be supplied uncompressed or in gzip or zstd
compressed format. Use the `tune` or `summarise` command in a simple shell script
to update the number and order of regex patterns in your pattern file according
to their matched frequency (refer to the examples directory of the `grepq` GitHub
repository, https://github.com/Rbfinch/grepq), further targeting and speeding up
the filtering process.

Examples:

Print only the matching sequences
    grepq regex.txt file.fastq

Print the matching sequences with the record ID
    grepq -I regex.txt file.fastq

Print the matching sequences in FASTA format
    grepq -F regex.txt file.fastq

Print the matching sequences in FASTQ format
    grepq -R regex.txt file.fastq

Save the matching sequences in gzip compressed FASTQ format
    grepq -R --write-gzip regex.txt file.fastq > output.fastq.gz

Read the FASTQ file in gzip compressed format
    grepq --read-gzip regex.txt file.fastq.gz

Read and save the output in gzip compressed format, with fast compression
    grepq --read-gzip --write-gzip --fast regex.txt file.fastq.gz > output.fastq.gz

Read and save the output in gzip compressed format, with best compression
    grepq --read-gzip --write-gzip --best regex.txt file.fastq.gz > output.fastq.gz

Read and save the output in zstd compressed format, with best compression
    grepq --read-zstd --write-zstd --best regex.txt file.fastq.zst > output.fastq.zst

Count the number of matching FASTQ records
    grepq -c regex.txt file.fastq

For each matched pattern in a search of no more than 100000 matches, print the
    pattern and the number of matches
    grepq regex.txt file.fastq tune -n 100000 -c

For each matched pattern in a search of no more than 100000 matches of a
    gzip-compressed FASTQ file, print the pattern and the number of matches
    grepq --read-gzip regex.txt file.fastq.gz tune -n 100000 -c

For each matched pattern in a search of no more than 100000 matches of a
gzip-compressed FASTQ file, print the pattern and the number of matches to a 
JSON file called matches.json
    grepq --read-gzip regex.json file.fastq.gz tune -n 100000 -c --names --json-matches

As above, but uses the summarise command to ensure that all FASTQ records are processed
    grepq --read-gzip regex.json file.fastq.gz summarise -c --names --json-matches

For each matched pattern in a search of no more than 100000 matches of a
gzip-compressed FASTQ file, print the pattern and the number of matches to a 
JSON file called matches.json, and include the top three most frequent variants of
each pattern, and their respective counts
    grepq --read-gzip regex.json file.fastq.gz tune -n 100000 -c --names --json-matches --variants 3

As above, but uses the summarise command to ensure that all FASTQ records are processed
    grepq --read-gzip regex.json file.fastq.gz summarise -c --names --json-matches --variants 3

For each matched pattern in a search of no more than 100000 matches of a
gzip-compressed FASTQ file, print the pattern and the number of matches to a JSON
file called matches.json, and include all variants of each pattern, and their
respective counts. Note that the `--variants` argument is not given when `--all`
is specified.
    grepq --read-gzip regex.json file.fastq.gz tune -n 100000 -c --names --json-matches --all

As above, but uses the summarise command to ensure that all FASTQ records are processed
    grepq --read-gzip regex.json file.fastq.gz summarise -c --names --json-matches --all

Print the records where none of the regex patterns are found
    grepq regex.txt file.fastq inverted

Print the records where none of the regex patterns are found, with the record ID
    grepq -I regex.txt file.fastq inverted

Print the records where none of the regex patterns are found, in FASTQ format
    grepq -R regex.txt file.fastq inverted

Count the number of records where none of the regex patterns are found
    grepq -c regex.txt file.fastq inverted

Count the total number of records in the FASTQ file using an empty pattern file
    grepq -c empty.txt file.fastq inverted

For a gzip-compressed FASTQ file, bucket matched sequences into separate files
named after each regexName, with the output in FASTQ format
    grepq -R --bucket --read-gzip regex.json file.fastq.gz

For a gzip-compressed FASTQ file, bucket matched sequences into separate files
named after each regexName, with the output in FASTQ format, and write a SQLite database file,
limiting the number of tetranucleotides in the TNF field to two
    grepq -R --read-gzip --writeSQL -N 2 --bucket regex.json file.fastq.gz

Tips:

1. Predicates can be used to filter on the header field (= record ID line)
using a regex, minimum sequence length, and minimum average quality score
(supports Phred+33 and Phred+64). Predicates are specified in a JSON pattern file.
For an example, see regex-and-predicates.json in the examples directory of the
`grepq` GitHub repository (https://github.com/Rbfinch/grepq). Note that regex 
supplied to filter on the header field is first passed as a string to the regex
engine, and then the regex engine is used to match the header field. If you get
an error message, be sure to escape any special characters in the regex pattern.

2. Use the `tune` or `summarise` command (`grepq tune -h` and `grepq summarise -h`
for instructions) in a simple shell script to update the number and order of regex
patterns in your pattern file according to their matched frequency, further targeting
and speeding up the filtering process. When the patterns file is given in JSON 
format, then specifying the `-c`, `--names`, `--json-matches` and `--variants` 
options to the `tune` or `summarise` command will output the matched pattern 
variants and their corresponding counts in JSON format to a file called `matches.json`,
allowing named regex sets, named regex patterns, and named and unnamed variants.
See 16S-no-iupac.txt, 16S-iupac.json, 16S-no-iupac.json and 16S-no-iupac.json for
examples of JSON pattern files, and matches.json for an example of the output of
the `tune` or `summarise` command in JSON format (example files are located in the
examples directory of the `grepq` GitHub repository: https://github.com/Rbfinch/grepq)
(see also the Examples and Notes sections). To list all variants of a pattern, use
the `--all` option. Note that the `--variants` argument is not given when `--all`
is specified.

3. Use the `inverted` command to identify records that do not match any of the
regex patterns in your pattern file.

4. Ensure you have enough storage space for output files.

Notes:

1. `grepq` can output to several formats, including those that are
gzip or zstd compressed. `grepq`, however, will only accept a FASTQ file or a 
compressed (gzip or zstd) FASTQ file as the sequence data file. If you get an

called `fastq_data` with the following fields: the fastq record (header, sequence
and quality fields), length of the sequence field (length), percent GC content (GC),
percent GC content as an integer (GC_int), number of unique tetranucleotides in the
sequence (nTN), percent tetranucleotide frequency within the sequence (TNF), and
a JSON array containing the matched regex patterns, the matches and their position(s)
in the FASTQ sequence (variants). If the pattern file was given in JSON format and
contained a non-null qualityEncoding field, then the average quality score for the
sequence field (average_quality) will also be written. The `--num-tetranucleotides`
option can be used to limit the number of tetranucleotides written to the TNF field
of the fastq_data SQLite table, these being the most or equal most frequent
tetranucleotides in the sequence field of the matched FASTQ records. A summary of
the invoked query (pattern and data files) is written to a second table called
`query`.

examples of JSON pattern files, and matches.json for an example of the output of
the `tune` or `summarise` command in JSON format (example files are located in the
examples directory of the `grepq` GitHub repository: https://github.com/Rbfinch/grepq)
(see also the Examples and Notes sections). To list all variants of a pattern, use
the `--all` option. Note that the `--variants` argument is not given when `--all`
is specified.

3. Use the `inverted` command to identify records that do not match any of the
regex patterns in your pattern file.

4. Ensure you have enough storage space for output files.

Notes:

1. `grepq` can output to several formats, including those that are
gzip or zstd compressed. `grepq`, however, will only accept a FASTQ file or a 
compressed (gzip or zstd) FASTQ file as the sequence data file. If you get an
error message, check that the input data file is a FASTQ file or a gzip or zstd
compressed FASTQ file, and that you have specified the correct file format 
(--read-gzip or --read-zstd for FASTQ files compressed by gzip and zstd,
respectively), and file path.

2. Other than when the `inverted` command is given, output to a SQLite database
is supported with the `writeSQL` option. The SQLite database will contain a table
called `fastq_data` with the following fields: the fastq record (header, sequence
and quality fields), length of the sequence field (length), percent GC content (GC),
percent GC content as an integer (GC_int), number of unique tetranucleotides in the
sequence (nTN), percent tetranucleotide frequency within the sequence (TNF), and
a JSON array containing the matched regex patterns, the matches and their position(s)
in the FASTQ sequence (variants). If the pattern file was given in JSON format and
contained a non-null qualityEncoding field, then the average quality score for the
sequence field (average_quality) will also be written. The `--num-tetranucleotides`
option can be used to limit the number of tetranucleotides written to the TNF field
of the fastq_data SQLite table, these being the most or equal most frequent
tetranucleotides in the sequence field of the matched FASTQ records. A summary of
the invoked query (pattern and data files) is written to a second table called
`query`.

3. Pattern files must contain one regex pattern per line or be given in JSON
format, and patterns are case-sensitive (you can supply an empty pattern file to
count the total number of records in the FASTQ file). The regex patterns should
only include the DNA sequence characters (A, C, G, T), or IUPAC ambiguity codes
(N, R, Y, ...). See 16S-no-iupac.txt, 16S-iupac.json and  
16S-iupac-and-predicates.json in the examples directory of the `grepq` GitHub
repository (https://github.com/Rbfinch/grepq) for examples of valid pattern files.
Regex patterns to match the header field (= record ID line) must comply with the
Rust regex library syntax (<https://docs.rs/regex/latest/regex/#syntax>). If you
get an error message, be sure to escape any special characters in the regex 
pattern.

4. When no options are provided, only the matching sequences are printed.

5. Only one of the -I, -F, -R, or -c options can be used at a time.

6. The --read-gzip [--read-zstd] and --write-gzip [--write-zstd] options can be
used separately, or together, and in combination with any of the other filtering
options (the --write-gzip [--write-zstd] option cannot be used with the `tune` 
or `summarise` command).

7. The count option (-c) will support the output of the -R option since it is in
FASTQ format.

8. Other than when the `tune` or `summarise` command is run, a FASTQ record is
deemed to match (and hence provided in the output) when any of the regex patterns
in the pattern file match the sequence field of the FASTQ record.
        
9. When the count option (-c) is given with the `tune` or `summarise` command,
`grepq` will count the number of FASTQ records containing a sequence that is 
matched, for each matching regex in the pattern file. If, however, there are 
multiple occurrences of a given regex within a FASTQ record sequence field, `grepq`
will count this as one match. To ensure all records are processed, use the 
`summarise` command instead of the `tune` command.

10. When the count option (-c) is not given as part of the `tune` or `summarise`
command, `grepq` prints the total number of matching FASTQ records for the set
of regex patterns in the pattern file.

11. Regex patterns with look-around and backreferences are not supported.

Overview:

`grepq` searches the sequence line of FASTQ records for regular
expressions that are contained in a text or JSON file, or it searches for the
absence of those regular expressions when used with the `inverted` command. The 
FASTQ file on which it operates can be supplied uncompressed or in gzip or zstd
compressed format. Use the `tune` or `summarise` command in a simple shell script
to update the number and order of regex patterns in your pattern file according
to their matched frequency (refer to the examples directory of the `grepq` GitHub
repository, https://github.com/Rbfinch/grepq), further targeting and speeding up
the filtering process.

Examples:

Print only the matching sequences
    grepq regex.txt file.fastq

Print the matching sequences with the record ID
    grepq -I regex.txt file.fastq

Print the matching sequences in FASTA format
    grepq -F regex.txt file.fastq

Print the matching sequences in FASTQ format
    grepq -R regex.txt file.fastq

Save the matching sequences in gzip compressed FASTQ format
    grepq -R --write-gzip regex.txt file.fastq > output.fastq.gz

Read the FASTQ file in gzip compressed format
    grepq --read-gzip regex.txt file.fastq.gz

Read and save the output in gzip compressed format, with fast compression
    grepq --read-gzip --write-gzip --fast regex.txt file.fastq.gz > output.fastq.gz

Read and save the output in gzip compressed format, with best compression
    grepq --read-gzip --write-gzip --best regex.txt file.fastq.gz > output.fastq.gz

Read and save the output in zstd compressed format, with best compression
    grepq --read-zstd --write-zstd --best regex.txt file.fastq.zst > output.fastq.zst

Count the number of matching FASTQ records
    grepq -c regex.txt file.fastq

For each matched pattern in a search of no more than 100000 matches, print the
    pattern and the number of matches
    grepq regex.txt file.fastq tune -n 100000 -c

For each matched pattern in a search of no more than 100000 matches of a
    gzip-compressed FASTQ file, print the pattern and the number of matches
    grepq --read-gzip regex.txt file.fastq.gz tune -n 100000 -c

For each matched pattern in a search of no more than 100000 matches of a
gzip-compressed FASTQ file, print the pattern and the number of matches to a 
JSON file called matches.json
    grepq --read-gzip regex.json file.fastq.gz tune -n 100000 -c --names --json-matches

As above, but uses the summarise command to ensure that all FASTQ records are processed
    grepq --read-gzip regex.json file.fastq.gz summarise -c --names --json-matches

For each matched pattern in a search of no more than 100000 matches of a
gzip-compressed FASTQ file, print the pattern and the number of matches to a 
JSON file called matches.json, and include the top three most frequent variants of
each pattern, and their respective counts
    grepq --read-gzip regex.json file.fastq.gz tune -n 100000 -c --names --json-matches --variants 3

As above, but uses the summarise command to ensure that all FASTQ records are processed
    grepq --read-gzip regex.json file.fastq.gz summarise -c --names --json-matches --variants 3

For each matched pattern in a search of no more than 100000 matches of a
gzip-compressed FASTQ file, print the pattern and the number of matches to a JSON
file called matches.json, and include all variants of each pattern, and their
respective counts. Note that the `--variants` argument is not given when `--all`
is specified.
    grepq --read-gzip regex.json file.fastq.gz tune -n 100000 -c --names --json-matches --all

As above, but uses the summarise command to ensure that all FASTQ records are processed
    grepq --read-gzip regex.json file.fastq.gz summarise -c --names --json-matches --all

Print the records where none of the regex patterns are found
    grepq regex.txt file.fastq inverted

Print the records where none of the regex patterns are found, with the record ID
    grepq -I regex.txt file.fastq inverted

Print the records where none of the regex patterns are found, in FASTQ format
    grepq -R regex.txt file.fastq inverted

Count the number of records where none of the regex patterns are found
    grepq -c regex.txt file.fastq inverted

Count the total number of records in the FASTQ file using an empty pattern file
    grepq -c empty.txt file.fastq inverted

For a gzip-compressed FASTQ file, bucket matched sequences into separate files
named after each regexName, with the output in FASTQ format
    grepq -R --bucket --read-gzip regex.json file.fastq.gz

For a gzip-compressed FASTQ file, bucket matched sequences into separate files
named after each regexName, with the output in FASTQ format, and write a SQLite database file,
limiting the number of tetranucleotides in the TNF field to two
    grepq -R --read-gzip --writeSQL -N 2 --bucket regex.json file.fastq.gz

Tips:

1. Predicates can be used to filter on the header field (= record ID line)
using a regex, minimum sequence length, and minimum average quality score
(supports Phred+33 and Phred+64). Predicates are specified in a JSON pattern file.
For an example, see regex-and-predicates.json in the examples directory of the
`grepq` GitHub repository (https://github.com/Rbfinch/grepq). Note that regex 
supplied to filter on the header field is first passed as a string to the regex
engine, and then the regex engine is used to match the header field. If you get
an error message, be sure to escape any special characters in the regex pattern.

2. Use the `tune` or `summarise` command (`grepq tune -h` and `grepq summarise -h`
for instructions) in a simple shell script to update the number and order of regex
patterns in your pattern file according to their matched frequency, further targeting
and speeding up the filtering process. When the patterns file is given in JSON 
format, then specifying the `-c`, `--names`, `--json-matches` and `--variants` 
options to the `tune` or `summarise` command will output the matched pattern 
variants and their corresponding counts in JSON format to a file called `matches.json`,
allowing named regex sets, named regex patterns, and named and unnamed variants.
See 16S-no-iupac.txt, 16S-iupac.json, 16S-no-iupac.json and 16S-no-iupac.json for
examples of JSON pattern files, and matches.json for an example of the output of
the `tune` or `summarise` command in JSON format (example files are located in the
examples directory of the `grepq` GitHub repository: https://github.com/Rbfinch/grepq)
(see also the Examples and Notes sections). To list all variants of a pattern, use
the `--all` option. Note that the `--variants` argument is not given when `--all`
is specified.

3. Use the `inverted` command to identify records that do not match any of the
regex patterns in your pattern file.

an error message, be sure to escape any special characters in the regex pattern.

2. Use the `tune` or `summarise` command (`grepq tune -h` and `grepq summarise -h`
for instructions) in a simple shell script to update the number and order of regex
patterns in your pattern file according to their matched frequency, further targeting
and speeding up the filtering process. When the patterns file is given in JSON 
format, then specifying the `-c`, `--names`, `--json-matches` and `--variants` 
options to the `tune` or `summarise` command will output the matched pattern 
variants and their corresponding counts in JSON format to a file called `matches.json`,
allowing named regex sets, named regex patterns, and named and unnamed variants.
See 16S-no-iupac.txt, 16S-iupac.json, 16S-no-iupac.json and 16S-no-iupac.json for
examples of JSON pattern files, and matches.json for an example of the output of
the `tune` or `summarise` command in JSON format (example files are located in the
examples directory of the `grepq` GitHub repository: https://github.com/Rbfinch/grepq)
(see also the Examples and Notes sections). To list all variants of a pattern, use
the `--all` option. Note that the `--variants` argument is not given when `--all`
is specified.

3. Use the `inverted` command to identify records that do not match any of the
regex patterns in your pattern file.

4. Ensure you have enough storage space for output files.

Notes:

1. `grepq` can output to several formats, including those that are
gzip or zstd compressed. `grepq`, however, will only accept a FASTQ file or a 
compressed (gzip or zstd) FASTQ file as the sequence data file. If you get an
error message, check that the input data file is a FASTQ file or a gzip or zstd
compressed FASTQ file, and that you have specified the correct file format 
(--read-gzip or --read-zstd for FASTQ files compressed by gzip and zstd,
respectively), and file path.

2. Other than when the `inverted` command is given, output to a SQLite database
is supported with the `writeSQL` option. The SQLite database will contain a table
called `fastq_data` with the following fields: the fastq record (header, sequence
and quality fields), length of the sequence field (length), percent GC content (GC),
percent GC content as an integer (GC_int), number of unique tetranucleotides in the
sequence (nTN), percent tetranucleotide frequency within the sequence (TNF), and
a JSON array containing the matched regex patterns, the matches and their position(s)
in the FASTQ sequence (variants). If the pattern file was given in JSON format and
contained a non-null qualityEncoding field, then the average quality score for the
sequence field (average_quality) will also be written. The `--num-tetranucleotides`
option can be used to limit the number of tetranucleotides written to the TNF field
of the fastq_data SQLite table, these being the most or equal most frequent
tetranucleotides in the sequence field of the matched FASTQ records. A summary of
the invoked query (pattern and data files) is written to a second table called
`query`.

3. Pattern files must contain one regex pattern per line or be given in JSON
format, and patterns are case-sensitive (you can supply an empty pattern file to
count the total number of records in the FASTQ file). The regex patterns should
only include the DNA sequence characters (A, C, G, T), or IUPAC ambiguity codes
(N, R, Y, ...). See 16S-no-iupac.txt, 16S-iupac.json and  
16S-iupac-and-predicates.json in the examples directory of the `grepq` GitHub
repository (https://github.com/Rbfinch/grepq) for examples of valid pattern files.
Regex patterns to match the header field (= record ID line) must comply with the
Rust regex library syntax (<https://docs.rs/regex/latest/regex/#syntax>). If you
get an error message, be sure to escape any special characters in the regex 
pattern.

4. When no options are provided, only the matching sequences are printed.

5. Only one of the -I, -F, -R, or -c options can be used at a time.

6. The --read-gzip [--read-zstd] and --write-gzip [--write-zstd] options can be
used separately, or together, and in combination with any of the other filtering
options (the --write-gzip [--write-zstd] option cannot be used with the `tune` 
or `summarise` command).

7. The count option (-c) will support the output of the -R option since it is in
FASTQ format.

8. Other than when the `tune` or `summarise` command is run, a FASTQ record is
deemed to match (and hence provided in the output) when any of the regex patterns
in the pattern file match the sequence field of the FASTQ record.
        
9. When the count option (-c) is given with the `tune` or `summarise` command,
`grepq` will count the number of FASTQ records containing a sequence that is 
matched, for each matching regex in the pattern file. If, however, there are 
multiple occurrences of a given regex within a FASTQ record sequence field, `grepq`
will count this as one match. To ensure all records are processed, use the 
`summarise` command instead of the `tune` command.

10. When the count option (-c) is not given as part of the `tune` or `summarise`
command, `grepq` prints the total number of matching FASTQ records for the set
of regex patterns in the pattern file.

11. Regex patterns with look-around and backreferences are not supported.

Read and save the output in zstd compressed format, with best compression
    grepq --read-zstd --write-zstd --best regex.txt file.fastq.zst > output.fastq.zst

Count the number of matching FASTQ records
    grepq -c regex.txt file.fastq

For each matched pattern in a search of no more than 100000 matches, print the
    pattern and the number of matches
    grepq regex.txt file.fastq tune -n 100000 -c

For each matched pattern in a search of no more than 100000 matches of a
    gzip-compressed FASTQ file, print the pattern and the number of matches
    grepq --read-gzip regex.txt file.fastq.gz tune -n 100000 -c

For each matched pattern in a search of no more than 100000 matches of a
gzip-compressed FASTQ file, print the pattern and the number of matches to a 
JSON file called matches.json
    grepq --read-gzip regex.json file.fastq.gz tune -n 100000 -c --names --json-matches

As above, but uses the summarise command to ensure that all FASTQ records are processed
    grepq --read-gzip regex.json file.fastq.gz summarise -c --names --json-matches

For each matched pattern in a search of no more than 100000 matches of a
gzip-compressed FASTQ file, print the pattern and the number of matches to a 
JSON file called matches.json, and include the top three most frequent variants of
each pattern, and their respective counts
    grepq --read-gzip regex.json file.fastq.gz tune -n 100000 -c --names --json-matches --variants 3

As above, but uses the summarise command to ensure that all FASTQ records are processed
    grepq --read-gzip regex.json file.fastq.gz summarise -c --names --json-matches --variants 3

For each matched pattern in a search of no more than 100000 matches of a
gzip-compressed FASTQ file, print the pattern and the number of matches to a JSON
file called matches.json, and include all variants of each pattern, and their
respective counts. Note that the `--variants` argument is not given when `--all`
is specified.
    grepq --read-gzip regex.json file.fastq.gz tune -n 100000 -c --names --json-matches --all

As above, but uses the summarise command to ensure that all FASTQ records are processed

    grepq -c regex.txt file.fastq inverted

Count the total number of records in the FASTQ file using an empty pattern file
    grepq -c empty.txt file.fastq inverted

For a gzip-compressed FASTQ file, bucket matched sequences into separate files
named after each regexName, with the output in FASTQ format
    grepq -R --bucket --read-gzip regex.json file.fastq.gz

For a gzip-compressed FASTQ file, bucket matched sequences into separate files
named after each regexName, with the output in FASTQ format, and write a SQLite database file,
limiting the number of tetranucleotides in the TNF field to two
    grepq -R --read-gzip --writeSQL -N 2 --bucket regex.json file.fastq.gz

Tips:

1. Predicates can be used to filter on the header field (= record ID line)
using a regex, minimum sequence length, and minimum average quality score
(supports Phred+33 and Phred+64). Predicates are specified in a JSON pattern file.
For an example, see regex-and-predicates.json in the examples directory of the
`grepq` GitHub repository (https://github.com/Rbfinch/grepq). Note that regex 
supplied to filter on the header field is first passed as a string to the regex
engine, and then the regex engine is used to match the header field. If you get
an error message, be sure to escape any special characters in the regex pattern.

2. Use the `tune` or `summarise` command (`grepq tune -h` and `grepq summarise -h`
for instructions) in a simple shell script to update the number and order of regex
patterns in your pattern file according to their matched frequency, further targeting

format, then specifying the `-c`, `--names`, `--json-matches` and `--variants` 
options to the `tune` or `summarise` command will output the matched pattern 
variants and their corresponding counts in JSON format to a file called `matches.json`,
allowing named regex sets, named regex patterns, and named and unnamed variants.
See 16S-no-iupac.txt, 16S-iupac.json, 16S-no-iupac.json and 16S-no-iupac.json for
examples of JSON pattern files, and matches.json for an example of the output of
the `tune` or `summarise` command in JSON format (example files are located in the
examples directory of the `grepq` GitHub repository: https://github.com/Rbfinch/grepq)
(see also the Examples and Notes sections). To list all variants of a pattern, use
the `--all` option. Note that the `--variants` argument is not given when `--all`

named after each regexName, with the output in FASTQ format, and write a SQLite database file,
limiting the number of tetranucleotides in the TNF field to two
    grepq -R --read-gzip --writeSQL -N 2 --bucket regex.json file.fastq.gz

Tips:

1. Predicates can be used to filter on the header field (= record ID line)
using a regex, minimum sequence length, and minimum average quality score
(supports Phred+33 and Phred+64). Predicates are specified in a JSON pattern file.
For an example, see regex-and-predicates.json in the examples directory of the
`grepq` GitHub repository (https://github.com/Rbfinch/grepq). Note that regex 
supplied to filter on the header field is first passed as a string to the regex
engine, and then the regex engine is used to match the header field. If you get
an error message, be sure to escape any special characters in the regex pattern.

2. Use the `tune` or `summarise` command (`grepq tune -h` and `grepq summarise -h`
for instructions) in a simple shell script to update the number and order of regex
patterns in your pattern file according to their matched frequency, further targeting
and speeding up the filtering process. When the patterns file is given in JSON 
format, then specifying the `-c`, `--names`, `--json-matches` and `--variants` 
options to the `tune` or `summarise` command will output the matched pattern 
variants and their corresponding counts in JSON format to a file called `matches.json`,
allowing named regex sets, named regex patterns, and named and unnamed variants.
See 16S-no-iupac.txt, 16S-iupac.json, 16S-no-iupac.json and 16S-no-iupac.json for
examples of JSON pattern files, and matches.json for an example of the output of
the `tune` or `summarise` command in JSON format (example files are located in the
examples directory of the `grepq` GitHub repository: https://github.com/Rbfinch/grepq)
(see also the Examples and Notes sections). To list all variants of a pattern, use
the `--all` option. Note that the `--variants` argument is not given when `--all`
is specified.

3. Use the `inverted` command to identify records that do not match any of the
regex patterns in your pattern file.

4. Ensure you have enough storage space for output files.

Notes:

1. `grepq` can output to several formats, including those that are
gzip or zstd compressed. `grepq`, however, will only accept a FASTQ file or a 
compressed (gzip or zstd) FASTQ file as the sequence data file. If you get an
error message, check that the input data file is a FASTQ file or a gzip or zstd
compressed FASTQ file, and that you have specified the correct file format 
(--read-gzip or --read-zstd for FASTQ files compressed by gzip and zstd,
respectively), and file path.

2. Other than when the `inverted` command is given, output to a SQLite database
is supported with the `writeSQL` option. The SQLite database will contain a table
called `fastq_data` with the following fields: the fastq record (header, sequence
and quality fields), length of the sequence field (length), percent GC content (GC),
percent GC content as an integer (GC_int), number of unique tetranucleotides in the
sequence (nTN), percent tetranucleotide frequency within the sequence (TNF), and
a JSON array containing the matched regex patterns, the matches and their position(s)
in the FASTQ sequence (variants). If the pattern file was given in JSON format and
contained a non-null qualityEncoding field, then the average quality score for the
sequence field (average_quality) will also be written. The `--num-tetranucleotides`
option can be used to limit the number of tetranucleotides written to the TNF field
of the fastq_data SQLite table, these being the most or equal most frequent
tetranucleotides in the sequence field of the matched FASTQ records. A summary of
the invoked query (pattern and data files) is written to a second table called
`query`.

3. Pattern files must contain one regex pattern per line or be given in JSON
format, and patterns are case-sensitive (you can supply an empty pattern file to
count the total number of records in the FASTQ file). The regex patterns should
only include the DNA sequence characters (A, C, G, T), or IUPAC ambiguity codes
(N, R, Y, ...). See 16S-no-iupac.txt, 16S-iupac.json and  
16S-iupac-and-predicates.json in the examples directory of the `grepq` GitHub
repository (https://github.com/Rbfinch/grepq) for examples of valid pattern files.
Regex patterns to match the header field (= record ID line) must comply with the
Rust regex library syntax (<https://docs.rs/regex/latest/regex/#syntax>). If you
get an error message, be sure to escape any special characters in the regex 
pattern.

4. When no options are provided, only the matching sequences are printed.

5. Only one of the -I, -F, -R, or -c options can be used at a time.

6. The --read-gzip [--read-zstd] and --write-gzip [--write-zstd] options can be
used separately, or together, and in combination with any of the other filtering
options (the --write-gzip [--write-zstd] option cannot be used with the `tune` 
or `summarise` command).

7. The count option (-c) will support the output of the -R option since it is in
FASTQ format.

8. Other than when the `tune` or `summarise` command is run, a FASTQ record is
deemed to match (and hence provided in the output) when any of the regex patterns
in the pattern file match the sequence field of the FASTQ record.
        
9. When the count option (-c) is given with the `tune` or `summarise` command,
`grepq` will count the number of FASTQ records containing a sequence that is 
matched, for each matching regex in the pattern file. If, however, there are 
multiple occurrences of a given regex within a FASTQ record sequence field, `grepq`
will count this as one match. To ensure all records are processed, use the 
`summarise` command instead of the `tune` command.

10. When the count option (-c) is not given as part of the `tune` or `summarise`
command, `grepq` prints the total number of matching FASTQ records for the set
of regex patterns in the pattern file.

11. Regex patterns with look-around and backreferences are not supported.

limiting the number of tetranucleotides in the TNF field to two
    grepq -R --read-gzip --writeSQL -N 2 --bucket regex.json file.fastq.gz

Tips:

1. Predicates can be used to filter on the header field (= record ID line)
using a regex, minimum sequence length, and minimum average quality score
(supports Phred+33 and Phred+64). Predicates are specified in a JSON pattern file.
For an example, see regex-and-predicates.json in the examples directory of the
`grepq` GitHub repository (https://github.com/Rbfinch/grepq). Note that regex 
supplied to filter on the header field is first passed as a string to the regex
engine, and then the regex engine is used to match the header field. If you get
an error message, be sure to escape any special characters in the regex pattern.

2. Use the `tune` or `summarise` command (`grepq tune -h` and `grepq summarise -h`
for instructions) in a simple shell script to update the number and order of regex
patterns in your pattern file according to their matched frequency, further targeting
and speeding up the filtering process. When the patterns file is given in JSON 
format, then specifying the `-c`, `--names`, `--json-matches` and `--variants` 
options to the `tune` or `summarise` command will output the matched pattern 
variants and their corresponding counts in JSON format to a file called `matches.json`,
allowing named regex sets, named regex patterns, and named and unnamed variants.
See 16S-no-iupac.txt, 16S-iupac.json, 16S-no-iupac.json and 16S-no-iupac.json for
examples of JSON pattern files, and matches.json for an example of the output of
the `tune` or `summarise` command in JSON format (example files are located in the
examples directory of the `grepq` GitHub repository: https://github.com/Rbfinch/grepq)
(see also the Examples and Notes sections). To list all variants of a pattern, use
the `--all` option. Note that the `--variants` argument is not given when `--all`
is specified.

3. Use the `inverted` command to identify records that do not match any of the
regex patterns in your pattern file.

4. Ensure you have enough storage space for output files.

Notes:

1. `grepq` can output to several formats, including those that are
gzip or zstd compressed. `grepq`, however, will only accept a FASTQ file or a 
compressed (gzip or zstd) FASTQ file as the sequence data file. If you get an
error message, check that the input data file is a FASTQ file or a gzip or zstd
compressed FASTQ file, and that you have specified the correct file format 
(--read-gzip or --read-zstd for FASTQ files compressed by gzip and zstd,
respectively), and file path.

2. Other than when the `inverted` command is given, output to a SQLite database
is supported with the `writeSQL` option. The SQLite database will contain a table
called `fastq_data` with the following fields: the fastq record (header, sequence
and quality fields), length of the sequence field (length), percent GC content (GC),
percent GC content as an integer (GC_int), number of unique tetranucleotides in the
sequence (nTN), percent tetranucleotide frequency within the sequence (TNF), and
a JSON array containing the matched regex patterns, the matches and their position(s)
in the FASTQ sequence (variants). If the pattern file was given in JSON format and
contained a non-null qualityEncoding field, then the average quality score for the
sequence field (average_quality) will also be written. The `--num-tetranucleotides`
option can be used to limit the number of tetranucleotides written to the TNF field
of the fastq_data SQLite table, these being the most or equal most frequent
tetranucleotides in the sequence field of the matched FASTQ records. A summary of
the invoked query (pattern and data files) is written to a second table called
`query`.

3. Pattern files must contain one regex pattern per line or be given in JSON
format, and patterns are case-sensitive (you can supply an empty pattern file to
count the total number of records in the FASTQ file). The regex patterns should
only include the DNA sequence characters (A, C, G, T), or IUPAC ambiguity codes
(N, R, Y, ...). See 16S-no-iupac.txt, 16S-iupac.json and  
16S-iupac-and-predicates.json in the examples directory of the `grepq` GitHub
repository (https://github.com/Rbfinch/grepq) for examples of valid pattern files.
Regex patterns to match the header field (= record ID line) must comply with the
Rust regex library syntax (<https://docs.rs/regex/latest/regex/#syntax>). If you
get an error message, be sure to escape any special characters in the regex 
pattern.

4. When no options are provided, only the matching sequences are printed.

5. Only one of the -I, -F, -R, or -c options can be used at a time.

6. The --read-gzip [--read-zstd] and --write-gzip [--write-zstd] options can be
used separately, or together, and in combination with any of the other filtering
options (the --write-gzip [--write-zstd] option cannot be used with the `tune` 
or `summarise` command).

7. The count option (-c) will support the output of the -R option since it is in
FASTQ format.

8. Other than when the `tune` or `summarise` command is run, a FASTQ record is
deemed to match (and hence provided in the output) when any of the regex patterns
in the pattern file match the sequence field of the FASTQ record.
        
9. When the count option (-c) is given with the `tune` or `summarise` command,
`grepq` will count the number of FASTQ records containing a sequence that is 
matched, for each matching regex in the pattern file. If, however, there are 
multiple occurrences of a given regex within a FASTQ record sequence field, `grepq`
will count this as one match. To ensure all records are processed, use the 
`summarise` command instead of the `tune` command.

10. When the count option (-c) is not given as part of the `tune` or `summarise`
command, `grepq` prints the total number of matching FASTQ records for the set
of regex patterns in the pattern file.

11. Regex patterns with look-around and backreferences are not supported.

For each matched pattern in a search of no more than 100000 matches of a
gzip-compressed FASTQ file, print the pattern and the number of matches to a JSON
file called matches.json, and include all variants of each pattern, and their
respective counts. Note that the `--variants` argument is not given when `--all`
is specified.

    grepq --read-gzip regex.json file.fastq.gz summarise -c --names --json-matches --all

Print the records where none of the regex patterns are found
    grepq regex.txt file.fastq inverted

Print the records where none of the regex patterns are found, with the record ID
    grepq -I regex.txt file.fastq inverted

Print the records where none of the regex patterns are found, in FASTQ format
    grepq -R regex.txt file.fastq inverted

Count the number of records where none of the regex patterns are found
    grepq -c regex.txt file.fastq inverted

Count the total number of records in the FASTQ file using an empty pattern file
    grepq -c empty.txt file.fastq inverted

For a gzip-compressed FASTQ file, bucket matched sequences into separate files
named after each regexName, with the output in FASTQ format
    grepq -R --bucket --read-gzip regex.json file.fastq.gz

For a gzip-compressed FASTQ file, bucket matched sequences into separate files
named after each regexName, with the output in FASTQ format, and write a SQLite database file,
limiting the number of tetranucleotides in the TNF field to two
    grepq -R --read-gzip --writeSQL -N 2 --bucket regex.json file.fastq.gz

Tips:

1. Predicates can be used to filter on the header field (= record ID line)
using a regex, minimum sequence length, and minimum average quality score
(supports Phred+33 and Phred+64). Predicates are specified in a JSON pattern file.
For an example, see regex-and-predicates.json in the examples directory of the
`grepq` GitHub repository (https://github.com/Rbfinch/grepq). Note that regex 
supplied to filter on the header field is first passed as a string to the regex
engine, and then the regex engine is used to match the header field. If you get
an error message, be sure to escape any special characters in the regex pattern.

2. Use the `tune` or `summarise` command (`grepq tune -h` and `grepq summarise -h`
for instructions) in a simple shell script to update the number and order of regex
patterns in your pattern file according to their matched frequency, further targeting
and speeding up the filtering process. When the patterns file is given in JSON 
format, then specifying the `-c`, `--names`, `--json-matches` and `--variants` 
options to the `tune` or `summarise` command will output the matched pattern 
variants and their corresponding counts in JSON format to a file called `matches.json`,
allowing named regex sets, named regex patterns, and named and unnamed variants.
See 16S-no-iupac.txt, 16S-iupac.json, 16S-no-iupac.json and 16S-no-iupac.json for
examples of JSON pattern files, and matches.json for an example of the output of
the `tune` or `summarise` command in JSON format (example files are located in the
examples directory of the `grepq` GitHub repository: https://github.com/Rbfinch/grepq)
(see also the Examples and Notes sections). To list all variants of a pattern, use
the `--all` option. Note that the `--variants` argument is not given when `--all`
is specified.

3. Use the `inverted` command to identify records that do not match any of the
regex patterns in your pattern file.

4. Ensure you have enough storage space for output files.

Notes:

1. `grepq` can output to several formats, including those that are
gzip or zstd compressed. `grepq`, however, will only accept a FASTQ file or a 
compressed (gzip or zstd) FASTQ file as the sequence data file. If you get an
error message, check that the input data file is a FASTQ file or a gzip or zstd
compressed FASTQ file, and that you have specified the correct file format 
(--read-gzip or --read-zstd for FASTQ files compressed by gzip and zstd,
respectively), and file path.

2. Other than when the `inverted` command is given, output to a SQLite database
is supported with the `writeSQL` option. The SQLite database will contain a table
called `fastq_data` with the following fields: the fastq record (header, sequence
and quality fields), length of the sequence field (length), percent GC content (GC),
percent GC content as an integer (GC_int), number of unique tetranucleotides in the
sequence (nTN), percent tetranucleotide frequency within the sequence (TNF), and
a JSON array containing the matched regex patterns, the matches and their position(s)
in the FASTQ sequence (variants). If the pattern file was given in JSON format and
contained a non-null qualityEncoding field, then the average quality score for the
sequence field (average_quality) will also be written. The `--num-tetranucleotides`
option can be used to limit the number of tetranucleotides written to the TNF field
of the fastq_data SQLite table, these being the most or equal most frequent
tetranucleotides in the sequence field of the matched FASTQ records. A summary of
the invoked query (pattern and data files) is written to a second table called
`query`.

3. Pattern files must contain one regex pattern per line or be given in JSON
format, and patterns are case-sensitive (you can supply an empty pattern file to
count the total number of records in the FASTQ file). The regex patterns should
only include the DNA sequence characters (A, C, G, T), or IUPAC ambiguity codes
(N, R, Y, ...). See 16S-no-iupac.txt, 16S-iupac.json and  
16S-iupac-and-predicates.json in the examples directory of the `grepq` GitHub
repository (https://github.com/Rbfinch/grepq) for examples of valid pattern files.
Regex patterns to match the header field (= record ID line) must comply with the
Rust regex library syntax (<https://docs.rs/regex/latest/regex/#syntax>). If you
get an error message, be sure to escape any special characters in the regex 
pattern.

4. When no options are provided, only the matching sequences are printed.

5. Only one of the -I, -F, -R, or -c options can be used at a time.

6. The --read-gzip [--read-zstd] and --write-gzip [--write-zstd] options can be
used separately, or together, and in combination with any of the other filtering
options (the --write-gzip [--write-zstd] option cannot be used with the `tune` 
or `summarise` command).

7. The count option (-c) will support the output of the -R option since it is in
FASTQ format.

8. Other than when the `tune` or `summarise` command is run, a FASTQ record is
deemed to match (and hence provided in the output) when any of the regex patterns
in the pattern file match the sequence field of the FASTQ record.
        
9. When the count option (-c) is given with the `tune` or `summarise` command,
`grepq` will count the number of FASTQ records containing a sequence that is 
matched, for each matching regex in the pattern file. If, however, there are 
multiple occurrences of a given regex within a FASTQ record sequence field, `grepq`
will count this as one match. To ensure all records are processed, use the 
`summarise` command instead of the `tune` command.

10. When the count option (-c) is not given as part of the `tune` or `summarise`
command, `grepq` prints the total number of matching FASTQ records for the set
of regex patterns in the pattern file.

11. Regex patterns with look-around and backreferences are not supported.

For a gzip-compressed FASTQ file, bucket matched sequences into separate files
named after each regexName, with the output in FASTQ format
    grepq -R --bucket --read-gzip regex.json file.fastq.gz

For a gzip-compressed FASTQ file, bucket matched sequences into separate files
named after each regexName, with the output in FASTQ format, and write a SQLite database file,
limiting the number of tetranucleotides in the TNF field to two
    grepq -R --read-gzip --writeSQL -N 2 --bucket regex.json file.fastq.gz

Tips:

1. Predicates can be used to filter on the header field (= record ID line)
using a regex, minimum sequence length, and minimum average quality score
(supports Phred+33 and Phred+64). Predicates are specified in a JSON pattern file.
For an example, see regex-and-predicates.json in the examples directory of the
`grepq` GitHub repository (https://github.com/Rbfinch/grepq). Note that regex 
supplied to filter on the header field is first passed as a string to the regex
engine, and then the regex engine is used to match the header field. If you get
an error message, be sure to escape any special characters in the regex pattern.

2. Use the `tune` or `summarise` command (`grepq tune -h` and `grepq summarise -h`
for instructions) in a simple shell script to update the number and order of regex
patterns in your pattern file according to their matched frequency, further targeting
and speeding up the filtering process. When the patterns file is given in JSON 
format, then specifying the `-c`, `--names`, `--json-matches` and `--variants` 
options to the `tune` or `summarise` command will output the matched pattern 
variants and their corresponding counts in JSON format to a file called `matches.json`,
allowing named regex sets, named regex patterns, and named and unnamed variants.
See 16S-no-iupac.txt, 16S-iupac.json, 16S-no-iupac.json and 16S-no-iupac.json for
examples of JSON pattern files, and matches.json for an example of the output of
the `tune` or `summarise` command in JSON format (example files are located in the
examples directory of the `grepq` GitHub repository: https://github.com/Rbfinch/grepq)
(see also the Examples and Notes sections). To list all variants of a pattern, use
the `--all` option. Note that the `--variants` argument is not given when `--all`
is specified.

3. Use the `inverted` command to identify records that do not match any of the
regex patterns in your pattern file.

4. Ensure you have enough storage space for output files.

Notes:

1. `grepq` can output to several formats, including those that are
gzip or zstd compressed. `grepq`, however, will only accept a FASTQ file or a 
compressed (gzip or zstd) FASTQ file as the sequence data file. If you get an
error message, check that the input data file is a FASTQ file or a gzip or zstd
compressed FASTQ file, and that you have specified the correct file format 
(--read-gzip or --read-zstd for FASTQ files compressed by gzip and zstd,
respectively), and file path.

2. Other than when the `inverted` command is given, output to a SQLite database
is supported with the `writeSQL` option. The SQLite database will contain a table
called `fastq_data` with the following fields: the fastq record (header, sequence
and quality fields), length of the sequence field (length), percent GC content (GC),
percent GC content as an integer (GC_int), number of unique tetranucleotides in the
sequence (nTN), percent tetranucleotide frequency within the sequence (TNF), and
a JSON array containing the matched regex patterns, the matches and their position(s)
in the FASTQ sequence (variants). If the pattern file was given in JSON format and
contained a non-null qualityEncoding field, then the average quality score for the
sequence field (average_quality) will also be written. The `--num-tetranucleotides`
option can be used to limit the number of tetranucleotides written to the TNF field
of the fastq_data SQLite table, these being the most or equal most frequent
tetranucleotides in the sequence field of the matched FASTQ records. A summary of
the invoked query (pattern and data files) is written to a second table called
`query`.

3. Pattern files must contain one regex pattern per line or be given in JSON
format, and patterns are case-sensitive (you can supply an empty pattern file to
count the total number of records in the FASTQ file). The regex patterns should
only include the DNA sequence characters (A, C, G, T), or IUPAC ambiguity codes
(N, R, Y, ...). See 16S-no-iupac.txt, 16S-iupac.json and  
16S-iupac-and-predicates.json in the examples directory of the `grepq` GitHub
repository (https://github.com/Rbfinch/grepq) for examples of valid pattern files.
Regex patterns to match the header field (= record ID line) must comply with the
Rust regex library syntax (<https://docs.rs/regex/latest/regex/#syntax>). If you
get an error message, be sure to escape any special characters in the regex 
pattern.

4. When no options are provided, only the matching sequences are printed.

5. Only one of the -I, -F, -R, or -c options can be used at a time.

6. The --read-gzip [--read-zstd] and --write-gzip [--write-zstd] options can be
used separately, or together, and in combination with any of the other filtering
options (the --write-gzip [--write-zstd] option cannot be used with the `tune` 
or `summarise` command).

7. The count option (-c) will support the output of the -R option since it is in
FASTQ format.

8. Other than when the `tune` or `summarise` command is run, a FASTQ record is
deemed to match (and hence provided in the output) when any of the regex patterns
in the pattern file match the sequence field of the FASTQ record.
        
9. When the count option (-c) is given with the `tune` or `summarise` command,
`grepq` will count the number of FASTQ records containing a sequence that is 
matched, for each matching regex in the pattern file. If, however, there are 
multiple occurrences of a given regex within a FASTQ record sequence field, `grepq`
will count this as one match. To ensure all records are processed, use the 
`summarise` command instead of the `tune` command.

10. When the count option (-c) is not given as part of the `tune` or `summarise`
command, `grepq` prints the total number of matching FASTQ records for the set
of regex patterns in the pattern file.

11. Regex patterns with look-around and backreferences are not supported.

For a gzip-compressed FASTQ file, bucket matched sequences into separate files
named after each regexName, with the output in FASTQ format, and write a SQLite database file,
limiting the number of tetranucleotides in the TNF field to two
    grepq -R --read-gzip --writeSQL -N 2 --bucket regex.json file.fastq.gz

Tips:

1. Predicates can be used to filter on the header field (= record ID line)
using a regex, minimum sequence length, and minimum average quality score
(supports Phred+33 and Phred+64). Predicates are specified in a JSON pattern file.
For an example, see regex-and-predicates.json in the examples directory of the
`grepq` GitHub repository (https://github.com/Rbfinch/grepq). Note that regex 
supplied to filter on the header field is first passed as a string to the regex
engine, and then the regex engine is used to match the header field. If you get
an error message, be sure to escape any special characters in the regex pattern.

2. Use the `tune` or `summarise` command (`grepq tune -h` and `grepq summarise -h`
for instructions) in a simple shell script to update the number and order of regex
patterns in your pattern file according to their matched frequency, further targeting
and speeding up the filtering process. When the patterns file is given in JSON 
format, then specifying the `-c`, `--names`, `--json-matches` and `--variants` 
options to the `tune` or `summarise` command will output the matched pattern 
variants and their corresponding counts in JSON format to a file called `matches.json`,
allowing named regex sets, named regex patterns, and named and unnamed variants.
See 16S-no-iupac.txt, 16S-iupac.json, 16S-no-iupac.json and 16S-no-iupac.json for
examples of JSON pattern files, and matches.json for an example of the output of
the `tune` or `summarise` command in JSON format (example files are located in the
examples directory of the `grepq` GitHub repository: https://github.com/Rbfinch/grepq)
(see also the Examples and Notes sections). To list all variants of a pattern, use
the `--all` option. Note that the `--variants` argument is not given when `--all`
is specified.

3. Use the `inverted` command to identify records that do not match any of the
regex patterns in your pattern file.

4. Ensure you have enough storage space for output files.

Notes:

1. `grepq` can output to several formats, including those that are
gzip or zstd compressed. `grepq`, however, will only accept a FASTQ file or a 
compressed (gzip or zstd) FASTQ file as the sequence data file. If you get an
error message, check that the input data file is a FASTQ file or a gzip or zstd
compressed FASTQ file, and that you have specified the correct file format 
(--read-gzip or --read-zstd for FASTQ files compressed by gzip and zstd,
respectively), and file path.

2. Other than when the `inverted` command is given, output to a SQLite database
is supported with the `writeSQL` option. The SQLite database will contain a table
called `fastq_data` with the following fields: the fastq record (header, sequence
and quality fields), length of the sequence field (length), percent GC content (GC),
percent GC content as an integer (GC_int), number of unique tetranucleotides in the
sequence (nTN), percent tetranucleotide frequency within the sequence (TNF), and
a JSON array containing the matched regex patterns, the matches and their position(s)
in the FASTQ sequence (variants). If the pattern file was given in JSON format and
contained a non-null qualityEncoding field, then the average quality score for the
sequence field (average_quality) will also be written. The `--num-tetranucleotides`
option can be used to limit the number of tetranucleotides written to the TNF field
of the fastq_data SQLite table, these being the most or equal most frequent
tetranucleotides in the sequence field of the matched FASTQ records. A summary of
the invoked query (pattern and data files) is written to a second table called
`query`.

3. Pattern files must contain one regex pattern per line or be given in JSON
format, and patterns are case-sensitive (you can supply an empty pattern file to
count the total number of records in the FASTQ file). The regex patterns should
only include the DNA sequence characters (A, C, G, T), or IUPAC ambiguity codes
(N, R, Y, ...). See 16S-no-iupac.txt, 16S-iupac.json and  
16S-iupac-and-predicates.json in the examples directory of the `grepq` GitHub
repository (https://github.com/Rbfinch/grepq) for examples of valid pattern files.
Regex patterns to match the header field (= record ID line) must comply with the
Rust regex library syntax (<https://docs.rs/regex/latest/regex/#syntax>). If you
get an error message, be sure to escape any special characters in the regex 
pattern.

4. When no options are provided, only the matching sequences are printed.

5. Only one of the -I, -F, -R, or -c options can be used at a time.

6. The --read-gzip [--read-zstd] and --write-gzip [--write-zstd] options can be
used separately, or together, and in combination with any of the other filtering
options (the --write-gzip [--write-zstd] option cannot be used with the `tune` 
or `summarise` command).

7. The count option (-c) will support the output of the -R option since it is in
FASTQ format.

8. Other than when the `tune` or `summarise` command is run, a FASTQ record is
deemed to match (and hence provided in the output) when any of the regex patterns
in the pattern file match the sequence field of the FASTQ record.
        
9. When the count option (-c) is given with the `tune` or `summarise` command,
`grepq` will count the number of FASTQ records containing a sequence that is 
matched, for each matching regex in the pattern file. If, however, there are 
multiple occurrences of a given regex within a FASTQ record sequence field, `grepq`
will count this as one match. To ensure all records are processed, use the 
`summarise` command instead of the `tune` command.

10. When the count option (-c) is not given as part of the `tune` or `summarise`
command, `grepq` prints the total number of matching FASTQ records for the set
of regex patterns in the pattern file.

11. Regex patterns with look-around and backreferences are not supported.
