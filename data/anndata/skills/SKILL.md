# anndata

## Overview
anndata is a specialized Python package designed to handle annotated data matrices, serving as a middle ground between the tabular flexibility of pandas and the N-dimensional array capabilities of xarray. It is the foundational data structure for the scverse ecosystem (including Scanpy). Use this skill when you need to organize large-scale numerical datasets where rows (observations) and columns (variables) require complex metadata that must remain synchronized during slicing, filtering, and analysis.

## Native Usage and Best Practices

### Core Data Structure
An `AnnData` object consists of several key components that should be used according to these standards:
- **X**: The primary data matrix (typically observations × variables). Can be a dense numpy array or a sparse scipy matrix.
- **obs**: A pandas DataFrame for observation metadata (e.g., cell types, batch IDs, donor info).
- **var**: A pandas DataFrame for variable metadata (e.g., gene symbols, feature types).
- **obsm / varm**: Dictionaries for multi-dimensional annotations (e.g., PCA coordinates, UMAP embeddings).
- **layers**: Dictionaries for alternative versions of the X matrix (e.g., raw counts vs. normalized data).
- **uns**: A dictionary for unstructured metadata (e.g., colors for plotting, analysis parameters).

### Efficient Data Handling
- **Sparse Matrices**: For single-cell data, always prefer sparse formats (CSR or CSC) to minimize memory footprint. `anndata` handles these natively.
- **Slicing**: Use standard Python slicing. `adata[obs_indices, var_indices]` automatically slices `obs`, `var`, `obsm`, and `layers` to maintain data integrity.
- **In-place Operations**: Many operations can be performed in-place to save memory, though standard slicing creates a "view" rather than a copy until modified.

### Persistence and I/O
- **H5AD Format**: Use the `.h5ad` (HDF5-based) format for saving data. It is optimized for `anndata` and supports compression.
- **Lazy Loading**: Use `backed` mode for datasets that exceed available RAM:
  ```python
  import anndata
  adata = anndata.read_h5ad("large_file.h5ad", backed="r")
  ```
- **Compression**: When writing files, use `compression="gzip"` to significantly reduce disk space for large sparse matrices.

### Expert Tips
- **Categorical Data**: Ensure metadata columns in `obs` are cast to pandas `category` types before saving to `.h5ad` to improve performance and reduce file size.
- **Unique Identifiers**: Always ensure `adata.obs_names` and `adata.var_names` are unique. Non-unique indices can cause silent failures during slicing or merging.
- **PyTorch Integration**: For machine learning workflows, use the built-in interface to convert `AnnData` objects into PyTorch-compatible formats for training.
