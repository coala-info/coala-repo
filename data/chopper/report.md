### Original Help Text

Filtering and trimming of fastq files. Reads on stdin and writes to stdout.

Usage: chopper [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

  -V, --version
          Print version

Filtering Options:
  -q, --quality <MINQUAL>
          Sets a minimum Phred average quality score
          
          [default: 0]

      --maxqual <MAXQUAL>
          Sets a maximum Phred average quality score
          
          [default: 1000]

  -l, --minlength <MINLENGTH>
          Sets a minimum read length
          
          [default: 1]

      --maxlength <MAXLENGTH>
          Sets a maximum read length
          
          [default: INF]

      --mingc <MINGC>
          Filter min GC content

      --maxgc <MAXGC>
          Filter max GC content

  -c, --contam <CONTAM>
          Filter contaminants against a fasta

Trimming Options:
      --trim-approach <TRIM_APPROACH>
          Select the trimming strategy to apply to the reads

          Possible values:
          - fixed-crop:           Remove a fixed number of bases from both ends of the read. Requires setting both --headcrop and --tailcrop
          - trim-by-quality:      Trim low-quality bases from the ends of the read until reaching a base with quality ≥ --cutoff
          - best-read-segment:    Extract the highest-quality read segment based on --cutoff, trimming low-quality bases from both ends
          - split-by-low-quality: Split reads by low-quality segments and output high-quality parts on the left and right, provided they pass the length filter

      --cutoff <CUTOFF>
          Set the minimum quality score (Q-score) threshold for trimming low-quality bases from read ends. Required when using the `trim-by-quality` or `best-read-segment` trimming approaches

      --headcrop <HEADCROP>
          Trim N bases from the start of each read. Required only when using the `fixed-crop` trimming approach
          
          [default: 0]

      --tailcrop <TAILCROP>
          Trim N bases from the end of each read. Required only when using the `fixed-crop` trimming approach
          
          [default: 0]

Setup Options:
  -t, --threads <THREADS>
          Use N parallel threads
          
          [default: 4]

  -i, --input <INPUT>
          Input filename [default: read from stdin]

      --inverse
          Output the opposite of the normal results
```
