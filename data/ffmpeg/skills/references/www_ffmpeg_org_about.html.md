# About FFmpeg

FFmpeg is the leading multimedia framework, able to **decode**, **encode**, **transcode**, **mux**, **demux**, **stream**, **filter** and **play** pretty much anything
that humans and machines have created. It supports the most obscure
ancient formats up to the cutting edge. No matter if they were
designed by some standards committee, the community or a corporation. It is
also highly portable: FFmpeg compiles, runs, and passes our testing infrastructure
[FATE](http://fate.ffmpeg.org) across Linux, Mac OS X,
Microsoft Windows, the BSDs, Solaris, etc. under a wide variety of build
environments, machine architectures, and configurations.

It contains libavcodec, libavutil, libavformat, libavfilter, libavdevice,
libswscale and libswresample which can be used by applications.
As well as ffmpeg, ffplay and ffprobe which can be used by
end users for **transcoding** and **playing**.

The FFmpeg project tries to provide the best technically possible
solution for developers of applications and end users alike. To achieve
this we combine the best free software options available. We slightly
favor our own code to keep the dependencies on other libs low and to
maximize code sharing between parts of FFmpeg.
Wherever the question of "best" cannot be answered we support both
options so the end user can choose.

Everyone is welcome in FFmpeg and all contributions are welcome too.
We are happy to receive patches, pull requests, bug reports, donations
or any other type of contribution.

Security is a high priority and code review is always done with
security in mind. Though due to the very large amounts of code touching
untrusted data security issues are unavoidable and thus we provide
as quick as possible updates to our last stable releases when
new security issues are found.

### FFmpeg Tools

[### **ffmpeg**

A **command line tool** to convert multimedia files
between formats](ffmpeg.html)

[### **ffplay**

A simple multimedia stream analyzer](ffprobe.html)

### FFmpeg Libraries for developers

* **[libavutil](libavutil.html)** is a library containing functions for
  simplifying programming, including random number generators, data
  structures, mathematics routines, core multimedia utilities, and much
  more.
* **[libavcodec](libavcodec.html)** is a library containing decoders and encoders
  for audio/video codecs.
* **[libavformat](libavformat.html)** is a library containing demuxers and
  muxers for multimedia container formats.
* **[libavdevice](libavdevice.html)** is a library containing input and output
  devices for grabbing from and rendering to many common multimedia
  input/output software frameworks, including Video4Linux, Video4Linux2,
  VfW, and ALSA.
* **[libavfilter](libavfilter.html)** is a library containing media filters.
* **[libswscale](libswscale.html)** is a library performing highly optimized image
  scaling and color space/pixel format conversion operations.
* **[libswresample](libswresample.html)** is a library performing highly optimized
  audio resampling, rematrixing and sample format conversion operations.
