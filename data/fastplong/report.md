fastplong: ultra-fast FASTQ preprocessing and quality control for long reads
version 0.4.1
usage: fastplong [options] ... 
options:
  -i, --in                           read input file name (string [=])
  -o, --out                          read output file name (string [=])
      --failed_out                   specify the file to store reads that cannot pass the filters. (string [=])
  -z, --compression                  compression level for gzip output (1 ~ 9). 1 is fastest, 9 is smallest, default is 4. (int [=4])
      --stdin                        input from STDIN.
      --stdout                       stream passing-filters reads to STDOUT. This option will result in interleaved FASTQ output for paired-end output. Disabled by default.

  -w, --thread                       worker thread number, default is 3 (int [=3])
      --split                        split output by limiting total split file number with this option (2~999), a sequential number prefix will be added to output name ( 0001.out.fq, 0002.out.fq...), disabled by default (int [=0])
      --split_by_lines               split output by limiting lines of each file with this option(>=1000), a sequential number prefix will be added to output name ( 0001.out.fq, 0002.out.fq...), disabled by default (long [=0])
