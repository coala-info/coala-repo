  General options
  -v, --verbose                        Select verbosity level (0-4). Default: 0

  -p, --threads                        Use NUM threads to run svaba. Default: 1
  -a, --id-string                      String specifying the analysis ID to be used as part of ID common.
  Main input
  -G, --reference-genome               Path to indexed reference genome to be used by BWA-MEM.
  -t, --case-bam                       Case BAM/CRAM/SAM file (eg tumor). Can input multiple.

      --germline                       Sets recommended settings for case-only analysis (eg germline). (-I, -L5, assembles NM >= 3 reads)
  Variant filtering and classification
      --lod                            LOD cutoff to classify indel as non-REF (tests AF=0 vs AF=MaxLikelihood(AF)) [8]
      --lod-dbsnp                      LOD cutoff to classify indel as non-REF (tests AF=0 vs AF=MaxLikelihood(AF)) at DBSnp indel site [5]
      --lod-somatic                    LOD cutoff to classify indel as somatic (tests AF=0 in normal vs AF=ML(0.5)) [2.5]
      --lod-somatic-dbsnp              LOD cutoff to classify indel as somatic (tests AF=0 in normal vs AF=ML(0.5)) at DBSnp indel site [4]
      --scale-errors                   Scale the priors that a site is artifact at given repeat count. 0 means assume low (const) error rate [1]
  Additional options
  -L, --mate-lookup-min                Minimum number of somatic reads required to attempt mate-region lookup [3]
  -s, --disc-sd-cutoff                 Number of standard deviations of calculated insert-size distribution to consider discordant. [3.92]
  -c, --chunk-size                     Size of a local assembly window (in bp). Set 0 for whole-BAM in one assembly. [25000]
  -x, --max-reads                      Max total read count to read in from assembly region. Set 0 to turn off. [50000]
  -M, --max-reads-mate-region          Max weird reads to include from a mate lookup region. [400]
  -C, --max-coverage                   Max read coverage to send to assembler (per BAM). Subsample reads if exceeded. [500]
      --no-interchrom-lookup           Skip mate lookup for inter-chr candidate events. Reduces power for translocations but less I/O.
      --discordant-only                Only run the discordant read clustering module, skip assembly. 
      --num-assembly-rounds            Run assembler multiple times. > 1 will bootstrap the assembly. [2]

      --hp                             Highly parallel. Don't write output until completely done. More memory, but avoids all thread-locks.
      --override-reference-check       With much caution, allows user to run svaba with different reference genomes for BAMs and -G
  Output options
  -z, --g-zip                          Gzip and tabix the output VCF files. [off]

  -Y, --microbial-genome               Path to indexed reference genome of microbial sequences to be used by BWA-MEM to filter reads.
  -V, --germline-sv-database           BED file containing sites of known germline SVs. Used as additional filter for somatic SV detection
  -R, --simple-seq-database            BED file containing sites of simple DNA that can confuse the contig re-alignment.
  Assembly and EC params

  -e, --error-rate                     Fractional difference two reads can have to overlap. See SGA. 0 is fast, but requires error correcting. [0]
  -K, --ec-correct-type                (f) Fermi-kit BFC correction, (s) Kmer-correction from SGA, (0) no correction (then suggest non-zero -e) [f]
  -E, --ec-subsample                   Learn from fraction of non-weird reads during error-correction. Lower number = faster compute [0.5]
