## Overview
TRIBAL (TRee Inference of B cell clonAl Lineages) is a computational framework designed to infer the evolutionary history of B cells from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. Unlike standard phylogenetic tools, TRIBAL jointly models two key biological processes: somatic hypermutation (SHM) and class switch recombination (CSR). It transforms raw B cell receptor (BCR) sequences and isotype information into a forest of lineage trees, providing insights into how different B cell clones evolve and transition between isotypes.

## Installation and Setup
The most reliable way to install TRIBAL is via Bioconda to ensure all bioinformatics dependencies (like MAFFT and PHYLIP) are correctly configured.

```bash
conda create -n tribal -c bioconda tribal
conda activate tribal
```

If using the preprocessing tools, ensure `dnapars` is installed by running the provided script in the source directory:
```bash
chmod +x dnapars_install.sh
./dnapars_install.sh
```

## Data Preparation
TRIBAL requires input data to be pre-clustered into clonotypes (cells descending from the same naive B cell). Tools like **Dandelion** are recommended for this initial clustering step.

### 1. Sequencing Data (CSV)
Prepare a CSV file containing the following mandatory columns:
- `cellid`: Unique identifier for each B cell.
- `clonotype`: The ID of the clonotype the cell belongs to.
- `heavy_chain_isotype`: The isotype of the heavy chain constant region.
- `heavy_chain_seq`: The variable region sequence of the heavy chain.
- `heavy_chain_allele`: The V allele of the heavy chain.

### 2. Germline Roots (CSV)
A separate CSV mapping clonotypes to their germline sequences:
- `clonotype`: The unique clonotype ID.
- `heavy_chain_root`: The heavy chain variable region germline root sequence.

## Command Line Usage
Verify the installation and explore available options using the help command:
```bash
tribal --help
```

## Python API Workflow
For more granular control or integration into bioinformatics pipelines, use the Python interface.

### Preprocessing
The `preprocess` function handles sequence alignment and parsimony forest construction. It automatically filters out clonotypes with insufficient cell counts.
```python
from tribal import preprocess

# Preprocess input dataframes
clonotypes = preprocess(df, roots, min_cells=3)
```

### Inference
The `Tribal` class is the main entry point for fitting the evolutionary model.
```python
from tribal import Tribal

# Initialize and run the algorithm
model = Tribal(clonotypes)
lineage_trees, transition_matrix = model.run()
```

## Best Practices and Expert Tips
- **Light Chain Integration**: While TRIBAL can run on heavy chains alone, providing light chain sequences (`light_chain_seq` and `light_chain_allele`) significantly improves the resolution of the inferred lineage trees.
- **Filtering**: Ensure your input data is high quality. TRIBAL's `preprocess` function will filter out cells with V alleles that differ from the germline root, which is a critical step for maintaining tree accuracy.
- **Isotype Transitions**: The output isotype transition probability matrix is a powerful tool for understanding the directionality of B cell maturation in your specific sample.
