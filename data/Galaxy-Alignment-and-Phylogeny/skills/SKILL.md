name: alignment-and-phylogeny
description: This transcriptomics workflow integrates outgroup, selected, and reference protein sequences using MAFFT for alignment, ClipKIT for trimming, and IQ-TREE for phylogenetic tree reconstruction. Use this skill when you need to investigate the evolutionary history of gene families or determine the phylogenetic placement of specific protein sequences within a broader taxonomic context.

# alignment-and-phylogeny

## Overview

This workflow is designed for transcriptomics and evolutionary biology studies focusing on the analysis of genes and gene families. It processes protein (AA) sequences from three distinct sources: outgroup sequences, selected sequences of interest, and reference or query sequences.

The pipeline begins by consolidating these inputs using [FASTA Merge Files and Filter Unique Sequences](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/galaxyp/fasta_merge_files_and_filter_unique_sequences/fasta_merge_files_and_filter_unique_sequences/1.2.0) to ensure a non-redundant dataset. These sequences are then aligned using [MAFFT](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/rnateam/mafft/rbc_mafft/7.526+galaxy1), a high-performance tool for multiple sequence alignment.

To enhance the accuracy of the evolutionary inference, the alignment is processed by [ClipKIT](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/padge/clipkit/clipkit/0.1.0), which trims uninformative or noisy sites. Finally, the workflow utilizes [IQ-TREE](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/iqtree/iqtree/2.4.0+galaxy1) to perform maximum likelihood phylogenomic analysis, generating a robust phylogenetic tree.

This workflow is released under the MIT license and provides a streamlined approach for researchers to move from raw protein sequences to refined phylogenetic trees. For detailed execution instructions, please refer to the README.md in the Files section.

## Inputs and data preparation

| Step | Label | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Outgroup sequences (AA) | data_input |  |
| 1 | Selected sequences (AA) | data_input |  |
| 2 | Reference/Query sequences (AA) | data_input |  |


Ensure all input files are provided in FASTA format containing amino acid (AA) sequences to remain compatible with the MAFFT and IQ-TREE tool configurations. While the workflow accepts individual datasets for the outgroup, selected, and reference sequences, using collections can help manage data if you are analyzing multiple gene families simultaneously. Consult the `README.md` for comprehensive details on parameter settings and outgroup selection criteria. For automated testing or command-line execution, consider using `planemo workflow_job_init` to create a `job.yml` file.

## How to run (Planemo)

### Local Galaxy (default engine)

```bash
planemo run Galaxy-Workflow-Alignment_and_Phylogeny.ga job.yml --download_outputs --output_directory . --output_json output.json
```

Optional: `--galaxy_root /path/to/galaxy` speeds up spinning up a local Galaxy.

### Docker Galaxy

Append e.g. `--engine docker_galaxy --ignore_dependency_problems` (requires Docker).

### External Galaxy (usegalaxy.org / EU / …)

```bash
planemo run Galaxy-Workflow-Alignment_and_Phylogeny.ga job.yml --engine external_galaxy --galaxy_url SERVER_URL --galaxy_user_key YOUR_API_KEY
```

Create a reusable profile: `planemo profile_create myprofile --galaxy_url ... --galaxy_user_key ... --engine external_galaxy` then `planemo run Galaxy-Workflow-Alignment_and_Phylogeny.ga job.yml --profile myprofile`.

### Job file

- Generate a template: `planemo workflow_job_init Galaxy-Workflow-Alignment_and_Phylogeny.ga -o job.yml`
- Lint: `planemo workflow_lint Galaxy-Workflow-Alignment_and_Phylogeny.ga`

See **[Running Galaxy workflows](https://planemo.readthedocs.io/en/master/running.html)** in the Planemo documentation.

## Invocation outputs

After a successful run with `--download_outputs`, files appear under your chosen `--output_directory`. `--output_json` records CWL-style metadata for outputs (paths, checksums).

On an external Galaxy, use `planemo invocation_download INVOCATION_ID --profile ...` to fetch outputs, or track progress with `planemo workflow_track INVOCATION_ID`.

Workflow steps marked as **workflow outputs** in the editor are listed under **Workflow outputs**; exact filenames depend on tools and Galaxy configuration.
