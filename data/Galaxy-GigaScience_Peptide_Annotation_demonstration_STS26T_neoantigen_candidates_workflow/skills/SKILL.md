description: This proteogenomics workflow annotates novel peptides and identifies neoantigen candidates by processing Fragpipe reports and genomic GTF/BED data through Query Tabular and PepPointer. Use this skill when you need to map mass spectrometry-derived peptide sequences to genomic coordinates to characterize potential neoantigens for cancer immunotherapy research.

# gigascience_peptide_annotation_demonstration_sts26t_neoantig

## Overview

This Galaxy workflow is designed for the annotation of novel peptides and neoantigen candidates, specifically demonstrating the process using STS26T data. It integrates mass spectrometry results with genomic information to identify and characterize potential neoantigens. The pipeline takes four primary inputs: a list of novel peptides, a Fragpipe peptide report, an annotated GFF-to-BED file, and a standard human reference genome GTF (GRCh38).

The workflow utilizes a series of [Query Tabular](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/query_tabular/query_tabular/3.3.2) and data transformation steps to map peptides to their corresponding proteins and genomic locations. Key processing stages include converting tabular data to FASTA format for IEDB compatibility and performing regex-based string modifications to clean and format peptide identifiers.

A central component of the analysis is the [PepPointer](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/galaxyp/pep_pointer/pep_pointer/0.1.3+galaxy1) tool, which provides automated annotation of peptides by cross-referencing them against genomic coordinates. The final output is a comprehensive neoantigen summary that consolidates peptide locations and protein annotations, facilitating the identification of tumor-specific variants.

This workflow is licensed under GPL-3.0-or-later and is tagged for use in [GTN](https://training.galaxyproject.org/) (Galaxy Training Network) tutorials related to neoantigen discovery and proteogenomics.

## Inputs and data preparation

| Step | Label | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Novel_Peptides | data_input | Candidate Neoantigens from Fragpipe Workflow |
| 1 | Fragpipe-Peptide-Report | data_input | Peptide report from Fragpipe workflow |
| 2 | Annotated-GffCompared-GTFtoBED | data_input | Annotated GffCompared GTF to BED |
| 3 | Homo_sapiens.GRCh38_canon.106.gtf | data_input | Homo_sapiens.GRCh38_canon.106.gtf |


To run this workflow, ensure your input files are correctly formatted as tabular (Novel_Peptides and Fragpipe-Peptide-Report), GTF (Homo_sapiens reference), and BED (Annotated-GffCompared-GTFtoBED) formats. Verify that the tabular reports contain the expected column headers for Query Tabular steps to execute successfully. For large-scale analysis, organizing these individual datasets into a single history is recommended before execution. Refer to the README.md for comprehensive details on specific column requirements and parameter settings. You can use `planemo workflow_job_init` to generate a `job.yml` file for automated execution.

## How to run (Planemo)

### Local Galaxy (default engine)

```bash
planemo run main-workflow.ga job.yml --download_outputs --output_directory . --output_json output.json
```

Optional: `--galaxy_root /path/to/galaxy` speeds up spinning up a local Galaxy.

### Docker Galaxy

Append e.g. `--engine docker_galaxy --ignore_dependency_problems` (requires Docker).

### External Galaxy (usegalaxy.org / EU / …)

```bash
planemo run main-workflow.ga job.yml --engine external_galaxy --galaxy_url SERVER_URL --galaxy_user_key YOUR_API_KEY
```

Create a reusable profile: `planemo profile_create myprofile --galaxy_url ... --galaxy_user_key ... --engine external_galaxy` then `planemo run main-workflow.ga job.yml --profile myprofile`.

### Job file

- Generate a template: `planemo workflow_job_init main-workflow.ga -o job.yml`
- Lint: `planemo workflow_lint main-workflow.ga`

See **[Running Galaxy workflows](https://planemo.readthedocs.io/en/master/running.html)** in the Planemo documentation.

## Invocation outputs

After a successful run with `--download_outputs`, files appear under your chosen `--output_directory`. `--output_json` records CWL-style metadata for outputs (paths, checksums).

On an external Galaxy, use `planemo invocation_download INVOCATION_ID --profile ...` to fetch outputs, or track progress with `planemo workflow_track INVOCATION_ID`.

Workflow steps marked as **workflow outputs** in the editor are listed under **Workflow outputs**; exact filenames depend on tools and Galaxy configuration.

- `main-workflow.ga` — Galaxy workflow export (JSON)
- `job.yml` — inputs/parameters for `planemo run` (create with `planemo workflow_job_init`)
