Input reads can be in FASTA or FASTQ format, uncompressed
or compressed with gz. Currently, PacBio (CLR, HiFi, corrected)
and ONT reads (regular, HQ, corrected) are supported. Expected error rates are
<15% for PB CLR/regular ONT; <3% for ONT R10, <3% for corrected, and <1% for HiFi. Note that Flye
was primarily developed to run on uncorrected reads. You may specify multiple
files with reads (separated by spaces). Mixing different read
types is not yet supported. The --meta option enables the mode
for metagenome/uneven coverage assembly.

To reduce memory consumption for large genome assemblies,
you can use a subset of the longest reads for initial disjointig
assembly by specifying --asm-coverage and --genome-size options. Typically,
40x coverage is enough to produce good disjointigs.

You can run Flye polisher as a standalone tool using
--polish-target option.
