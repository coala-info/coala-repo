## Overview
Emu is a specialized bioinformatics tool designed to estimate the relative abundance of microbial species from 16S rRNA gene sequencing data. Unlike simple alignment-based methods, Emu utilizes an Expectation-Maximization algorithm to improve accuracy, especially when dealing with reads that map to multiple organisms. Use this skill to guide the execution of Emu commands, manage taxonomic databases (like SILVA or RDP), and combine multiple sample outputs into a single profile.

## Core CLI Usage

### Basic Abundance Estimation
The primary command for processing a sample:
```bash
emu abundance <input.fastq> --db <path_to_database>
```

### Key Parameters and Optimization
- **--min-abundance**: Sets the threshold for species inclusion. By default, Emu uses a threshold equivalent to 1 read for samples < 1,000 reads, and 10 reads for larger samples. Increasing this can reduce false positives in low-depth samples.
- **--output-unclassified**: Use this flag to include a count of reads that could not be assigned to any taxa in the database.
- **--keep-read-assignments**: Generates a `.tsv` file showing the distribution of read assignments, useful for auditing specific classifications.

### Managing Databases
Emu requires a pre-built database to function. Common options include the default Emu database, SILVA, or RDP.
- Ensure the database path is explicitly provided if not set in the default environment.
- For custom databases, Emu can handle input taxonomy as a list of lineages.

### Post-Processing: Combining Results
To merge individual sample outputs into a single comparative table:
```bash
emu combine-outputs <directory_of_results> <output_name>
```
- **Note**: When using non-standard databases (like PR2), be aware that `combine-outputs` may normalize headers (e.g., changing 'domain' to 'superkingdom') to match standard Emu formatting.

## Expert Tips
- **Low Depth Handling**: If a sample has fewer than 1,000 reads, Emu is prone to overestimating taxa. Manually increase the `--min-abundance` parameter to filter out noise.
- **Memory Efficiency**: Versions 2.0.1 and later include significant optimizations for reduced memory consumption during the EM iteration phase.
- **Taxonomic Ranks**: While Emu defaults to species-level classification, it can include less specific ranks (genus, etc.) if the underlying database has gaps in taxonomic annotations.
