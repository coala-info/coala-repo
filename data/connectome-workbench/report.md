SMOOTH A VOLUME FILE
   wb_command -volume-smoothing
      <volume-in> - the volume to smooth
      <kernel> - the gaussian smoothing kernel sigma, in mm
      <volume-out> - output - the output volume

      [-roi] - smooth only from data within an ROI
         <roivol> - the volume to use as an ROI

      [-fix-zeros] - treat zero values as not being data

      [-subvolume] - select a single subvolume to smooth
         <subvol> - the subvolume number or name

      Gaussian smoothing for volumes.  By default, smooths all subvolumes with
      no ROI, if ROI is given, only positive voxels in the ROI volume have
      their values used, and all other voxels are set to zero.  Smoothing a
      non-orthogonal volume will be significantly slower, because the operation
      cannot be separated into 1-dimensional smoothings without distorting the
      kernel shape.

      The -fix-zeros option causes the smoothing to not use an input value if
      it is zero, but still write a smoothed value to the voxel.  This is
      useful for zeros that indicate lack of information, preventing them from
      pulling down the intensity of nearby voxels, while giving the zero an
      extrapolated value.

      Resamples a surface file, given two spherical surfaces that are in
      register.  If ADAP_BARY_AREA is used, exactly one of -area-surfs or
      -area-metrics must be specified.  This method is not generally
      recommended for surface resampling, but is provided for completeness.

      The BARYCENTRIC method is generally recommended for anatomical surfaces,
      in order to minimize smoothing.

      For cut surfaces (including flatmaps), use -surface-cut-resample.

      Instead of resampling a spherical surface, the
      -surface-sphere-project-unproject command is recommended.

      The <method> argument must be one of the following:

      ADAP_BARY_AREA
      BARYCENTRIC

      Calculates isotropic and anisotropic distortions in the volume warpfield.
      At each voxel, the gradient of the absolute warpfield is computed to
      obtain the local affine transforms for each voxel (jacobian matrices),
      and strain tensors are derived from them.  The isotropic component
      (volumetric expansion ratio) is the product of the three principal
      strains.  The default measure ('elongation') for the anisotropic
      component is the largest principal strain divided by the smallest.

      The -circular option instead calculates the anisotropic component by
      transforming the principal strains into log space, considering them as
      x-values of points on a circle 120 degrees apart, finds the circle's
      diameter, and transforms that back to a ratio.

FIND EXTREMA IN A VOLUME FILE
   wb_command -volume-extrema
      <volume-in> - volume file to find the extrema of
      <distance> - the minimum distance between identified extrema of the same
         type
      <volume-out> - output - the output extrema volume

      [-presmooth] - smooth the volume before finding extrema
         <kernel> - the sigma for the gaussian smoothing kernel, in mm

      [-roi] - ignore values outside the selected area
         <roi-volume> - the area to find extrema in

      [-threshold] - ignore small extrema
         <low> - the largest value to consider for being a minimum
         <high> - the smallest value to consider for being a maximum

      [-sum-subvols] - output the sum of the extrema subvolumes instead of each
         subvolume separately

      [-consolidate-mode] - use consolidation of local minima instead of a
         large neighborhood

      [-only-maxima] - only find the maxima

      [-only-minima] - only find the minima

      [-subvolume] - select a single subvolume to find extrema in
         <subvolume> - the subvolume number or name

      Finds extrema in a volume file, such that no two extrema of the same type
      are within <distance> of each other.  The extrema are labeled as -1 for
      minima, 1 for maxima, 0 otherwise.  If -only-maxima or -only-minima is
      specified, then it will ignore extrema not of the specified type.  These
      options are mutually exclusive.

      If -sum-subvols is specified, these extrema subvolumes are summed, and
      the output has a single subvolume with this result.

      By default, a datapoint is an extrema only if it is more extreme than
      every other datapoint that is within <distance> from it.  If
      -consolidate-mode is used, it instead starts by finding all datapoints
      that are more extreme than their immediate neighbors, then while there
      are any extrema within <distance> of each other, take the two extrema
      closest to each other and merge them into one by a weighted average based
      on how many original extrema have been merged into each.

      By default, all input subvolumes are used with no smoothing, use
      -subvolume to specify a single subvolume to use, and -presmooth to smooth
      the input before finding the extrema.

      label list file must have pairs of lines of the following format:

      <labelname>
      <value> <red> <green> <blue> <alpha>

      Do not specify the "unlabeled" key in the file, it is assumed that 0
      means not labeled unless -unlabeled-value is specified.  Label names must
      be on a separate line, but may contain spaces or other unusual characters
      (but not newline).  Whitespace is trimmed from both ends of the label
      name, but is kept if it is in the middle of a label.  The values of red,
      green, blue and alpha must be integers from 0 to 255, and will specify
      the color the label is drawn as (alpha of 255 means opaque, which is
      probably what you want).  By default, it will set new label names with
      names of LABEL_# for any values encountered that are not mentioned in the

      [-subvol-select] - select a single subvolume to map
         <subvol> - the subvolume number or name

      Map label volume data to a surface.  If -ribbon-constrained is not
      specified, uses the enclosing voxel method.  The ribbon mapping method
      constructs a polyhedron from the vertex's neighbors on each surface, and
      estimates the amount of this polyhedron's volume that falls inside any
      nearby voxels, to use as the weights for a popularity comparison.  If
      -thin-columns is specified, the polyhedron uses the edge midpoints and
      triangle centroids, so that neighboring vertices do not have overlapping
      polyhedra.  This may require increasing -voxel-subdiv to get enough
      samples in each voxel to reliably land inside these smaller polyhedra.
      The volume ROI is useful to exclude partial volume effects of voxels the
      surfaces pass through, and will cause the mapping to ignore voxels that
      don't have a positive value in the mask.  The subdivision number
      specifies how it approximates the amount of the volume the polyhedron
      intersects, by splitting each voxel into NxNxN pieces, and checking
      whether the center of each piece is inside the polyhedron.  If you have
      very large voxels, consider increasing this if you get unexpected
      unlabeled vertices in your output.

         [-repeat] - reuse a single subvolume for each subvolume of calculation

      This command evaluates <expression> at each voxel independently.  There
      must be at least one -var option (to get the volume space from), even if
      the <name> specified in it isn't used in <expression>.  All volumes must
      have the same volume space.  Filenames are not valid in <expression>, use
      a variable name and a -var option with matching <name> to specify an
      input file.  If the -subvolume option is given to any -var option, only
      one subvolume is used from that file.  If -repeat is specified, the file
      must either have only one subvolume, or have the -subvolume option
      specified.  All files that don't use -repeat must have the same number of
      subvolumes requested to be used.  The format of <expression> is as
      follows:

      Expressions consist of constants, variables, operators, parentheses, and
      functions, in infix notation, such as 'exp(-x + 3) * scale'.  Variables
      are strings of any length, using the characters a-z, A-Z, 0-9, and _, but
      may not take the name of a named constant.  Currently, there is only one
      named constant, PI.  The operators are +, -, *, /, ^, >, <, >=, <=, ==,
      !=, !, &&, ||.  These behave as in C, except that ^ is exponentiation,
      i.e. pow(x, y), and takes higher precedence than other binary operators
      (also, '-3^-4^-5' means '-(3^(-(4^-5)))').  The <=, >=, ==, and !=
      operators are given a small amount of wiggle room, equal to one millionth
      of the smaller of the absolute values of the values being compared.

      Comparison and logical operators return 0 or 1, you can do masking with
      expressions like 'x * (mask > 0)'.  For all logical operators, an input
      is considered true iff it is greater than 0.  The expression '0 < x < 5'
      is not syntactically wrong, but it will NOT do what is desired, because
      it is evaluated left to right, i.e. '((0 < x) < 5)', which will always
      return 1, as both possible results of a comparison are less than 5.  A
      warning is generated if an expression of this type is detected.  Use
      something like 'x > 0 && x < 5' to get the desired behavior.

      Whitespace between elements is ignored, ' sin ( 2 * x ) ' is equivalent
      to 'sin(2*x)', but 's in(2*x)' is an error.  Implied multiplication is
      not allowed, the expression '2x' will be parsed as a variable.
      Parentheses are (), do not use [] or {}.  Functions require parentheses,
      the expression 'sin x' is an error.

      The following functions are supported:

         sin: 1 argument, the sine of the argument (units are radians)
         cos: 1 argument, the cosine of the argument (units are radians)

      Threshold-free cluster enhancement is a method to increase the relative
      value of regions that would form clusters in a standard thresholding
      test.  This is accomplished by evaluating the integral of:

      e(h, p)^E * h^H * dh

      at each vertex p, where h ranges from 0 to the maximum value in the data,
      and e(h, p) is the extent of the cluster containing vertex p at threshold
      h.  Negative values are similarly enhanced by negating the data, running
      the same process, and negating the result.

      This method is explained in: Smith SM, Nichols TE., "Threshold-free
      cluster enhancement: addressing problems of smoothing, threshold
      dependence and localisation in cluster inference." Neuroimage. 2009 Jan

      [-subvol-select] - select a single subvolume to map
         <subvol> - the subvolume number or name

      You must specify exactly one mapping method.  Enclosing voxel uses the
      value from the voxel the vertex lies inside, while trilinear does a 3D
      linear interpolation based on the voxels immediately on each side of the
      vertex's position.

      The ribbon mapping method constructs a polyhedron from the vertex's
      neighbors on each surface, and estimates the amount of this polyhedron's
      volume that falls inside any nearby voxels, to use as the weights for
      sampling.  If -thin-columns is specified, the polyhedron uses the edge
      midpoints and triangle centroids, so that neighboring vertices do not
      have overlapping polyhedra.  This may require increasing -voxel-subdiv to
      get enough samples in each voxel to reliably land inside these smaller
      polyhedra.  The volume ROI is useful to exclude partial volume effects of
      voxels the surfaces pass through, and will cause the mapping to ignore
      voxels that don't have a positive value in the mask.  The subdivision
      number specifies how it approximates the amount of the volume the
      polyhedron intersects, by splitting each voxel into NxNxN pieces, and
      checking whether the center of each piece is inside the polyhedron.  If
      you have very large voxels, consider increasing this if you get zeros in
      your output.  The -gaussian option makes it act more like the myelin
      method, where the distance of a voxel from <surface> is used to
      downweight the voxel.

      The myelin style method uses part of the caret5 myelin mapping command to
      do the mapping: for each surface vertex, take all voxels that are in a
      cylinder with radius and height equal to cortical thickness, centered on
      the vertex and aligned with the surface normal, and that are also within
      the ribbon ROI, and apply a gaussian kernel with the specified sigma to
      them to get the weights to use.  The -legacy-bug flag reverts to the
      unintended behavior present from the initial implementation up to and
      including v1.2.3, which had only the tangential cutoff and a bounding box
      intended to be larger than where the cylinder cutoff should have been.

REGRESS AFFINE FROM WARPFIELD
   wb_command -volume-warpfield-affine-regression
      <warpfield> - the input warpfield
      <affine-out> - output - the output affine file

      [-roi] - only consider voxels within a mask (e.g., a brain mask)
         <roi-vol> - the mask volume

      [-fnirt] - input is a fnirt warpfield
         <source-volume> - the source volume used when generating the fnirt
            warpfield

      [-flirt-out] - write output as a flirt matrix rather than a world
         coordinate transform
         <source-volume> - the volume you want to apply the transform to
         <target-volume> - the target space you want the transformed volume to
            match

      For all voxels in the warpfield, do a regression that predicts the
      post-warp coordinate from the source coordinate.  When -roi is specified,
      only consider voxels with a value greater than 0 in <roi-vol>.

      The default is to expect the warpfield to be in relative world
      coordinates (mm space), and to write the output as a world affine (mm
      space to mm space).  If you are using FSL-created files and utilities,
      specify -fnirt and -flirt as needed, as their coordinate conventions are
      different.

EXPORT BORDER FILE TO CARET5 FILE FORMAT

         border/borderproj/bordercolor files

      [-surface] - repeatable - specify an input surface
         <surface-in> - a surface file for unprojection of borders

      A Workbench border file may contain borders for multiple structures and
      borders that are both projected and unprojected.  It also contains a
      color table for the borders. 

      Caret5 has both border (unprojected) and border projection (projected)
      files.  In addition, each Caret5 border or border projection file
      typically contains data for a single structure. Caret5 also uses a border
      color file that associates colors with the names of the borders. 

      This command will try to output both Caret5 border and border projection
      files.  Each output border/border projection file will contains data for
      one structure so there may be many files created.  The structure name is
      included in the name of each border or border projection file that is
      created. 

      One Caret5 border color file will also be produced by this command. 

      Providing surface(s) as input parameters is optional, but recommended.
      Surfaces may be needed to create both projected and/or unprojected
      coordinates of borders.  If there is a failure to produce an output
      border or border projection due to a missing surface with the matching
      structure, an error message will be displayed and some output files will
      not be created. 

      When writing new files, this command will overwrite a file with the same
      name.

      Averages rows for each map of the ROI(s), takes the correlation of each
      ROI average to the rest of the rows in the same file, then averages the
      results across all files.  ROIs are always treated as weighting
      functions, including negative values.  For efficiency, ensure that
      everything that is not intended to be used is zero in the ROI map.  If
      -cifti-roi is specified, -left-roi, -right-roi, -cerebellum-roi, and
      -vol-roi must not be specified.  If multiple non-cifti ROI files are
      specified, they must have the same number of columns.

      This command is used to convert a full CIFTI matrix to/from formats that
      can be used by programs that don't understand CIFTI.  You must specify
      exactly one of -to-gifti-ext, -from-gifti-ext, -to-nifti, -from-nifti,
      -to-text, or -from-text.

      If you want to write an existing CIFTI file with a different CIFTI
      version, see -file-convert, and its -cifti-version-convert option.

      If you want part of the CIFTI file as a metric, label, or volume file,
      see -cifti-separate.  If you want to create a CIFTI file from metric
      and/or volume files, see the -cifti-create-* commands.

      If you want to import a matrix that is restricted to an ROI, first create
      a template CIFTI file matching that ROI using a -cifti-create-* command.
      After importing to CIFTI, you can then expand the file into a standard
      brainordinates space with -cifti-create-dense-from-template.  If you want
      to export only part of a CIFTI file, first create an roi-restricted CIFTI
      file with -cifti-restrict-dense-mapping.

      The -transpose option to -from-gifti-ext is needed if the replacement
      binary file is in column-major order.

      The -unit options accept these values:

      SECOND
      HERTZ
      METER
      RADIAN

         [-cifti-roi] - use a cifti file for combined rois
            <roi-cifti> - the cifti roi file

      [-weights] - specify column weights
         <weight-file> - text file containing one weight per column

      [-fisher-z] - apply fisher small z transform (ie, artanh) to correlation

         normalize by diagonal

      [-covariance] - compute covariance instead of correlation

      [-mem-limit] - restrict memory usage
         <limit-GB> - memory limit in gigabytes

      For each row (or each row inside an roi if -roi-override is specified),
      correlate to all other rows.  The -cifti-roi suboption to -roi-override
      may not be specified with any other -*-roi suboption, but you may specify
      the other -*-roi suboptions together.

      When using the -fisher-z option, the output is NOT a Z-score, it is
      artanh(r), to do further math on this output, consider using -cifti-math.

      Restricting the memory usage will make it calculate the output in chunks,
      and if the input file size is more than 70% of the memory limit, it will
      also read through the input file as rows are required, resulting in
      several passes through the input file (once per chunk).  Memory limit
      does not need to be an integer, you may also specify 0 to calculate a
      single output row at a time (this may be very slow).

      This command helps you make a new dscalar, dtseries, or dlabel cifti file
      that matches the brainordinate space used in another cifti file.  The
      template file must have the desired brainordinate space in the mapping
      along the column direction (for dtseries, dscalar, dlabel, and symmetric
      dconn this is always the case).  All input cifti files must have a brain
      models mapping along column and use the same volume space and/or surface
      vertex count as the template for structures that they contain.  If any
      input files contain label data, then input files with non-label data are
      not allowed, and the -series option may not be used.

      Any structure that isn't covered by an input is filled with zeros or the
      unlabeled key.

      The <structure> argument of -metric, -label or -volume must be one of the

      The -volume option requires two volume arguments, the label-volume
      argument contains all labels you want to display (e.g. nuclei of the
      thalamus), whereas the structure-label-volume argument contains all CIFTI
      voxel-based structures you want to include data within (e.g.
      THALAMUS_LEFT, THALAMUS_RIGHT, etc).  See -volume-label-import and
      -volume-help for format details of label volume files.  If you just want
      the labels in voxels to be the structure names, you may use the same file
      for both arguments.  The structure-label-volume must use some of the
      label names from this list, all other label names in the

      output.

      When using the -fisher-z option, the output is NOT a Z-score, it is
      artanh(r), to do further math on this output, consider using -cifti-math.

      Restricting the memory usage will make it calculate the output in chunks,

         component

      For all data values designated as bad, if they neighbor a good value or
      are within the specified distance of a good value in the same kind of
      model, replace the value with a distance weighted average of nearby good
      values, otherwise set the value to zero.  If -nearest is specified, it
      will use the value from the closest good value within range instead of a
      weighted average.  When the input file contains label data, nearest
      dilation is used on the surface, and weighted popularity is used in the
      volume.

      The -*-corrected-areas options are intended for dilating on group average
      surfaces, but it is only an approximate correction for the reduction of
      structure in a group average surface.

      If -bad-brainordinate-roi is specified, all values, including those with
      value zero, are good, except for locations with a positive value in the
      ROI.  If it is not specified, only values equal to zero are bad.

      the specified direction.  COLUMN is the direction that works on dtseries
      and dscalar.  For dconn, if it is symmetric use COLUMN, otherwise use
      ROW.

      For each vertex, compute the average correlation within a range of
      geodesic distances that don't cross a sulcus/gyrus, and the correlation
      to the closest vertex crossing a sulcus/gyrus.  A vertex is considered to
      cross a sulcus/gyrus if the 3D distance is less than a third of the
      geodesic distance.  The output file contains the ratio between these
      correlations, and some additional maps to help explain the ratio.

         <value> - the numeric value for unlabeled (default 0)

      [-drop-unused-labels] - remove any unused label values from the label
         table

      Creates a cifti label file from a cifti file with label-like values.  You
      may specify the empty string ('' will work on linux/mac) for
      <label-list-file>, which will be treated as if it is an empty file.  It
      is assumed that a value of 0 in the input file means "unlabeled", unless
      -unlabeled-value is specified.  Do not specify the "unlabeled" label in
      the text file.

      The label list file must have the following format (2 lines per label):

      <labelname>
      <key> <red> <green> <blue> <alpha>
      ...

      Label names are specified on a separate line from their value and color,
      in order to let label names contain spaces.  Whitespace is trimmed from
      both ends of the label name, but is kept if it is in the middle of a
      label.  The value of <key> specifies what value in the imported file
      should be used as this label.  The values of <red>, <green>, <blue> and
      <alpha> must be integers from 0 to 255, and will specify the color the
      label is drawn as (alpha of 255 means fully opaque, which is probably
      what you want).

      By default, it will create new label names with names like LABEL_5 for
      any values encountered that are not mentioned in the list file, specify
      -discard-others to instead set these values to the "unlabeled" key.

      [-var] - repeatable - a cifti file to use as a variable

         <cifti> - the cifti file to use as this variable

         [-select] - repeatable - select a single index from a dimension
            <dim> - the dimension to select from (1-based)
            <index> - the index to use (1-based)

            [-repeat] - repeat the selected values for each index of output in
               this dimension

      This command evaluates <expression> at each matrix element independently.
      There must be at least one -var option (to get the output layout from),
      even if the <name> specified in it isn't used in <expression>.

      To select a single column from a 2D file (most cifti files are 2D), use
      -select 1 <index>, where <index> is 1-based.  To select a single row from
      a 2D file, use -select 2 <index>.  Where -select is not used, the cifti
      files must have compatible mappings (e.g., brain models and parcels
      mappings must match exactly except for parcel names).  Use
      -override-mapping-check to skip this checking.

      Filenames are not valid in <expression>, use a variable name and a -var
      option with matching <name> to specify an input file.  The format of
      <expression> is as follows:

      Expressions consist of constants, variables, operators, parentheses, and
      functions, in infix notation, such as 'exp(-x + 3) * scale'.  Variables
      are strings of any length, using the characters a-z, A-Z, 0-9, and _, but
      may not take the name of a named constant.  Currently, there is only one
      named constant, PI.  The operators are +, -, *, /, ^, >, <, >=, <=, ==,
      !=, !, &&, ||.  These behave as in C, except that ^ is exponentiation,
      i.e. pow(x, y), and takes higher precedence than other binary operators
      (also, '-3^-4^-5' means '-(3^(-(4^-5)))').  The <=, >=, ==, and !=
      operators are given a small amount of wiggle room, equal to one millionth
      of the smaller of the absolute values of the values being compared.

      Comparison and logical operators return 0 or 1, you can do masking with
      expressions like 'x * (mask > 0)'.  For all logical operators, an input
      is considered true iff it is greater than 0.  The expression '0 < x < 5'
      is not syntactically wrong, but it will NOT do what is desired, because
      it is evaluated left to right, i.e. '((0 < x) < 5)', which will always
      return 1, as both possible results of a comparison are less than 5.  A
      warning is generated if an expression of this type is detected.  Use
      something like 'x > 0 && x < 5' to get the desired behavior.

      Whitespace between elements is ignored, ' sin ( 2 * x ) ' is equivalent
      to 'sin(2*x)', but 's in(2*x)' is an error.  Implied multiplication is
      not allowed, the expression '2x' will be parsed as a variable.
      Parentheses are (), do not use [] or {}.  Functions require parentheses,
      the expression 'sin x' is an error.

      The following functions are supported:

         sin: 1 argument, the sine of the argument (units are radians)
         cos: 1 argument, the cosine of the argument (units are radians)
         tan: 1 argument, the tangent of the argument (units are radians)
         asin: 1 argument, the inverse of sine of the argument, in radians
         acos: 1 argument, the inverse of cosine of the argument, in radians
         atan: 1 argument, the inverse of tangent of the argument, in radians
         atan2: 2 arguments, atan2(y, x) returns the inverse of tangent of
      (y/x), in radians, determining quadrant by the sign of both arguments
         sinh: 1 argument, the hyperbolic sine of the argument
         cosh: 1 argument, the hyperbolic cosine of the argument
         tanh: 1 argument, the hyperboloc tangent of the argument
         asinh: 1 argument, the inverse hyperbolic sine of the argument
         acosh: 1 argument, the inverse hyperbolic cosine of the argument
         atanh: 1 argument, the inverse hyperboloc tangent of the argument
         ln: 1 argument, the natural logarithm of the argument
         exp: 1 argument, the constant e raised to the power of the argument
         log: 1 argument, the base 10 logarithm of the argument
         sqrt: 1 argument, the square root of the argument
         abs: 1 argument, the absolute value of the argument
         floor: 1 argument, the largest integer not greater than the argument
         round: 1 argument, the nearest integer, with ties rounded away from
      zero
         ceil: 1 argument, the smallest integer not less than the argument
         min: 2 arguments, min(x, y) returns y if (x > y), x otherwise

      -include-empty is specified, empty labels will be treated as parcels with
      no elements, and filled with a constant value.  The direction can be
      either an integer starting from 1, or the strings 'ROW' or 'COLUMN'.  For
      dtseries or dscalar, use COLUMN.  If you are parcellating a dconn in both
      directions, parcellating by ROW first will use much less memory.

      The parameter to the -method option must be one of the following:

      MAX: the maximum value
      MIN: the minimum value
      INDEXMAX: the 1-based index of the maximum value
      INDEXMIN: the 1-based index of the minimum value

      MEDIAN: the median of the data
      MODE: the mode of the data
      COUNT_NONZERO: the number of nonzero elements in the data

      The -*-weights options are mutually exclusive and may only be used with
      MEAN, SUM, STDEV, SAMPSTDEV, VARIANCE, MEDIAN, or MODE.

            from the roi

         <vector-metric-out> - output - the vectors as a metric file

      [-column] - select a single column to compute the gradient of
         <column> - the column number or name

      [-corrected-areas] - vertex areas to use instead of computing them from
         the surface
         <area-metric> - the corrected vertex areas, as a metric

      [-average-normals] - average the normals of each vertex with its
         neighbors before using them to compute the gradient

      At each vertex, the immediate neighbors are unfolded onto a plane tangent
      to the surface at the vertex (specifically, perpendicular to the normal).
      The gradient is computed using a regression between the unfolded
      positions of the vertices and their values.  The gradient is then given
      by the slopes of the regression, and reconstructed as a 3D gradient
      vector.  By default, takes the gradient of all columns, with no
      presmoothing, across the whole surface, without averaging the normals of
      the surface among neighbors.

      When using -corrected-areas, note that it is an approximate correction.
      Doing smoothing on individual surfaces before averaging/gradient is
      preferred, when possible, in order to make use of the original surface
      structure.

      Specifying an ROI will restrict the gradient to only use data from where
      the ROI metric is positive, and output zeros anywhere the ROI metric is
      not positive.

      By default, the first column of the roi metric is used for all input
      columns.  When -match-columns is specified to the -roi option, the input
      and roi metrics must have the same number of columns, and for each input
      column's index, the same column index is used in the roi metric.  If the
      -match-columns option to -roi is used while the -column option is also
      used, the number of columns of the roi metric must match the input
      metric, and it will use the roi column with the index of the selected
      input column.

      The vector output metric is organized such that the X, Y, and Z
      components from a single input column are consecutive columns.

      [-drop-unused-labels] - remove any unused label values from the label
         table

      Creates a new gifti label file from a metric file with label-like values.
      You may specify the empty string ('' will work on linux/mac) for
      <label-list-file>, which will be treated as if it is an empty file.  The
      label list file must have lines of the following format:

      <labelname>
      <value> <red> <green> <blue> <alpha>

      Do not specify the "unlabeled" key in the file, it is assumed that 0
      means not labeled unless -unlabeled-value is specified.  Label names must
      be on a separate line, but may contain spaces or other unusual characters
      (but not newline).  Whitespace is trimmed from both ends of the label
      name, but is kept if it is in the middle of a label.  The values of red,
      green, blue and alpha must be integers from 0 to 255, and will specify
      the color the label is drawn as (alpha of 255 means opaque, which is
      probably what you want).  By default, it will set new label names with
      names of LABEL_# for any values encountered that are not mentioned in the
      list file, specify -discard-others to instead set these voxels to the
      "unlabeled" key.

EVALUATE EXPRESSION ON METRIC FILES
   wb_command -metric-math
      <expression> - the expression to evaluate, in quotes
      <metric-out> - output - the output metric

      [-fixnan] - replace NaN results with a value
         <replace> - value to replace NaN with

      [-var] - repeatable - a metric to use as a variable
         <name> - the name of the variable, as used in the expression
         <metric> - the metric file to use as this variable

         [-column] - select a single column
            <column> - the column number or name

         [-repeat] - reuse a single column for each column of calculation

      This command evaluates <expression> at each surface vertex independently.
      There must be at least one -var option (to get the structure, number of
      vertices, and number of columns from), even if the <name> specified in it
      isn't used in <expression>.  All metrics must have the same number of
      vertices.  Filenames are not valid in <expression>, use a variable name
      and a -var option with matching <name> to specify an input file.  If the
      -column option is given to any -var option, only one column is used from
      that file.  If -repeat is specified, the file must either have only one
      column, or have the -column option specified.  All files that don't use
      -repeat must have the same number of columns requested to be used.  The
      format of <expression> is as follows:

      Expressions consist of constants, variables, operators, parentheses, and
      functions, in infix notation, such as 'exp(-x + 3) * scale'.  Variables
      are strings of any length, using the characters a-z, A-Z, 0-9, and _, but
      may not take the name of a named constant.  Currently, there is only one
      named constant, PI.  The operators are +, -, *, /, ^, >, <, >=, <=, ==,
      !=, !, &&, ||.  These behave as in C, except that ^ is exponentiation,
      i.e. pow(x, y), and takes higher precedence than other binary operators
      (also, '-3^-4^-5' means '-(3^(-(4^-5)))').  The <=, >=, ==, and !=
      operators are given a small amount of wiggle room, equal to one millionth
      of the smaller of the absolute values of the values being compared.

      Comparison and logical operators return 0 or 1, you can do masking with
      expressions like 'x * (mask > 0)'.  For all logical operators, an input
      is considered true iff it is greater than 0.  The expression '0 < x < 5'
      is not syntactically wrong, but it will NOT do what is desired, because
      it is evaluated left to right, i.e. '((0 < x) < 5)', which will always
      return 1, as both possible results of a comparison are less than 5.  A
      warning is generated if an expression of this type is detected.  Use
      something like 'x > 0 && x < 5' to get the desired behavior.

      Whitespace between elements is ignored, ' sin ( 2 * x ) ' is equivalent
      to 'sin(2*x)', but 's in(2*x)' is an error.  Implied multiplication is
      not allowed, the expression '2x' will be parsed as a variable.
      Parentheses are (), do not use [] or {}.  Functions require parentheses,
      the expression 'sin x' is an error.

      The following functions are supported:

         sin: 1 argument, the sine of the argument (units are radians)
         cos: 1 argument, the cosine of the argument (units are radians)
         tan: 1 argument, the tangent of the argument (units are radians)
         asin: 1 argument, the inverse of sine of the argument, in radians
         acos: 1 argument, the inverse of cosine of the argument, in radians
         atan: 1 argument, the inverse of tangent of the argument, in radians
         atan2: 2 arguments, atan2(y, x) returns the inverse of tangent of
      (y/x), in radians, determining quadrant by the sign of both arguments
         sinh: 1 argument, the hyperbolic sine of the argument
         cosh: 1 argument, the hyperbolic cosine of the argument
         tanh: 1 argument, the hyperboloc tangent of the argument
         asinh: 1 argument, the inverse hyperbolic sine of the argument
         acosh: 1 argument, the inverse hyperbolic cosine of the argument
         atanh: 1 argument, the inverse hyperboloc tangent of the argument
         ln: 1 argument, the natural logarithm of the argument
         exp: 1 argument, the constant e raised to the power of the argument
         log: 1 argument, the base 10 logarithm of the argument
         sqrt: 1 argument, the square root of the argument
         abs: 1 argument, the absolute value of the argument
         floor: 1 argument, the largest integer not greater than the argument
         round: 1 argument, the nearest integer, with ties rounded away from
      zero
         ceil: 1 argument, the smallest integer not less than the argument
         min: 2 arguments, min(x, y) returns y if (x > y), x otherwise
         max: 2 arguments, max(x, y) returns y if (x < y), x otherwise
         mod: 2 arguments, mod(x, y) = x - y * floor(x / y), or 0 if y == 0
         clamp: 3 arguments, clamp(x, low, high) = min(max(x, low), high)

      Resamples a metric file, given two spherical surfaces that are in

      -area-metrics must be specified.

      The ADAP_BARY_AREA method is recommended for ordinary metric data,
      because it should use all data while downsampling, unlike BARYCENTRIC.
      The recommended areas option for most data is individual midthicknesses
      for individual data, and averaged vertex area metrics from individual
      midthicknesses for group average data.

      The -current-roi option only masks the input, the output may be slightly
      dilated in comparison, consider using -metric-mask on the output when
      using -current-roi.

      The -largest option results in nearest vertex behavior when used with
      BARYCENTRIC.  When resampling a binary metric, consider thresholding at
      0.5 after resampling rather than using -largest.

      The <method> argument must be one of the following:

      ADAP_BARY_AREA
      BARYCENTRIC

SMOOTH A METRIC FILE
   wb_command -metric-smoothing
      <surface> - the surface to smooth on
      <metric-in> - the metric to smooth
      <smoothing-kernel> - the sigma for the gaussian kernel function, in mm
      <metric-out> - output - the output metric

      [-roi] - select a region of interest to smooth
         <roi-metric> - the roi to smooth within, as a metric

         [-match-columns] - for each input column, use the corresponding column
            from the roi

      [-fix-zeros] - treat zero values as not being data

      [-column] - select a single column to smooth
         <column> - the column number or name

      [-corrected-areas] - vertex areas to use instead of computing them from
         the surface
         <area-metric> - the corrected vertex areas, as a metric

      [-method] - select smoothing method, default GEO_GAUSS_AREA
         <method> - the name of the smoothing method

      Smooth a metric file on a surface.  By default, smooths all input columns
      on the entire surface, specify -column to use only one input column, and
      -roi to smooth only where the roi metric is greater than 0, outputting
      zeros elsewhere.

      When using -roi, input data outside the ROI is not used to compute the
      smoothed values.  By default, the first column of the roi metric is used
      for all input columns.  When -match-columns is specified to the -roi
      option, the input and roi metrics must have the same number of columns,
      and for each input column's index, the same column index is used in the
      roi metric.  If the -match-columns option to -roi is used while the
      -column option is also used, the number of columns must match between the
      roi and input metric, and it will use the roi column with the index of
      the selected input column.

      The -fix-zeros option causes the smoothing to not use an input value if
      it is zero, but still write a smoothed value to the vertex.  This is
      useful for zeros that indicate lack of information, preventing them from
      pulling down the intensity of nearby vertices, while giving the zero an
      extrapolated value.

      The -corrected-areas option is intended for when it is unavoidable to
      smooth on a group average surface, it is only an approximate correction
      for the reduction of structure in a group average surface.  It is better
      to smooth the data on individuals before averaging, when feasible.

      Valid values for <method> are:

      GEO_GAUSS_AREA - uses a geodesic gaussian kernel, and normalizes based on
      vertex area in order to work more reliably on irregular surfaces

      GEO_GAUSS_EQUAL - uses a geodesic gaussian kernel, and normalizes
      assuming each vertex has equal importance

      GEO_GAUSS - matches geodesic gaussian smoothing from caret5, but does not
      check kernels for having unequal importance

      The GEO_GAUSS_AREA method is the default because it is usually the
      correct choice.  GEO_GAUSS_EQUAL may be the correct choice when the sum
      of vertex values is more meaningful then the surface integral (sum of
      values .* areas), for instance when smoothing vertex areas (the sum is
      the total surface area, while the surface integral is the sum of squares
      of the vertex areas).  The GEO_GAUSS method is not recommended, it exists
      mainly to replicate methods of studies done with caret5's geodesic
      smoothing.

      [-corrected-areas] - vertex areas to use instead of computing them from
         the surface
         <area-metric> - the corrected vertex areas, as a metric

      Threshold-free cluster enhancement is a method to increase the relative
      value of regions that would form clusters in a standard thresholding
      test.  This is accomplished by evaluating the integral of:

      e(h, p)^E * h^H * dh

      at each vertex p, where h ranges from 0 to the maximum value in the data,
      and e(h, p) is the extent of the cluster containing vertex p at threshold
      h.  Negative values are similarly enhanced by negating the data, running
      the same process, and negating the result.

      When using -presmooth with -corrected-areas, note that it is an
      approximate correction within the smoothing algorithm (the TFCE
      correction is exact).  Doing smoothing on individual surfaces before
      averaging/TFCE is preferred, when possible, in order to better tie the
      smoothing kernel size to the original feature size.

      The TFCE method is explained in: Smith SM, Nichols TE., "Threshold-free
      cluster enhancement: addressing problems of smoothing, threshold
      dependence and localisation in cluster inference." Neuroimage. 2009 Jan
      1;44(1):83-98. PMID: 18501637

      Maps values from a metric file into a volume file.  You must specify
      exactly one mapping method option.  The -nearest-vertex method uses the
      value from the vertex closest to the voxel center (useful for integer
      values).  The -ribbon-constrained method uses the same method as in
      -volume-to-surface-mapping, then uses the weights in reverse.  Mapping to
      lower resolutions than the mesh may require a larger -voxel-subdiv value
      in order to have all of the surface data participate.

      Render content of browser windows displayed in a scene into image
      file(s).  The image file name should be similar to "capture.png".  If
      there is only one image to render, the image name will not change.  If
      there is more than one image to render, an index will be inserted into
      the image name: "capture_01.png", "capture_02.png" etc.

      If the scene references files in the Connectome Database,
      the "-conn-db-login" option is available for providing the 
      username and password.  If this options is not specified, 
      the username and password stored in the user's preferences
      is used.

      The image format is determined by the image file extension.
      The available image formats may vary by operating system.

      Compute the signed distance function of the reference surface at every
      vertex on the comparison surface.  NOTE: this relation is NOT symmetric,
      the line from a vertex to the closest point on the 'ref' surface (the one
      that defines the signed distance function) will only align with the
      normal of the 'ref' surface.  Valid specifiers for winding methods are as
      follows:

      EVEN_ODD (default)
      NEGATIVE
      NONZERO
      NORMALS

      The NORMALS method uses the normals of triangles and edges, or the
      closest triangle hit by a ray from the point.  This method may be
      slightly faster, but is only reliable for a closed surface that does not
      cross through itself.  All other methods count entry (positive) and exit
      (negative) crossings of a vertical ray from the point, then counts as
      inside if the total is odd, negative, or nonzero, respectively.

      This command, when not using -caret5-method, -edge-method, or

      method on the surface they came from if -smooth is specified, and then
      using the formula 'ln(distorted/reference)/ln(2)' on the smoothed
      results.

      When using -caret5-method, it uses the surface distortion method from
      caret5, which takes the base 2 log of the ratio of tile areas, then
      averages those results at each vertex, and then smooths the result on the
      reference surface.

      When using -edge-method, the -smooth option is ignored, and the output at
      each vertex is the average of 'abs(ln(refEdge/distortEdge)/ln(2))' over
      all edges connected to the vertex.

      When using -local-affine-method, the -smooth option is ignored.  The
      output is two columns, the first is the area distortion ratio, and the
      second is anisotropic strain.  These are calculated by an affine
      transform between matching triangles, and then averaged across the
      triangles of a vertex.

      Generate inflated and very inflated surfaces. The output surfaces are
      'matched' (have same XYZ range) to the anatomical surface. In most cases,
      an iterations-scale of 1.0 (default) is sufficient.  However, if the
      surface contains a large number of vertices (150,000), try an
      iterations-scale of 2.5.

COMPUTE GEODESIC DISTANCE FROM ONE VERTEX TO THE ENTIRE SURFACE
   wb_command -surface-geodesic-distance
      <surface> - the surface to compute on
      <vertex> - the vertex to compute geodesic distance from
      <metric-out> - output - the output metric

      [-naive] - use only neighbors, don't crawl triangles (not recommended)

      [-limit] - stop at a certain distance
         <limit-mm> - distance in mm to stop at

      [-corrected-areas] - vertex areas to use instead of computing them from
         the surface
         <area-metric> - the corrected vertex areas, as a metric

      Unless -limit is specified, computes the geodesic distance from the
      specified vertex to all others.  The result is output as a single column
      metric file, with a value of -1 for vertices that the distance was not
      computed for.

      The -corrected-areas option should be used when the input is a group
      average surface - group average surfaces have significantly less surface
      area than individual surfaces do, and therefore distances measured on
      them would be smaller than measuring them on individual surfaces.  In
      this case, the input to this option should be a group average of the
      output of -surface-vertex-areas for each subject.

      If -naive is not specified, the algorithm uses not just immediate
      neighbors, but also neighbors derived from crawling across pairs of
      triangles that share an edge.

      Computes geodesic distance from every vertex to every vertex, outputting

      vertices, see -surface-geodesic-distance.  When -limit is specified, any
      vertex beyond the limit is assigned the value -1.

      The -roi option makes the output file smaller by not outputting distances
      to or from vertices outside the ROI, but paths are still allowed to go
      outside the ROI when finding distances to other vertices.

      The -corrected-areas option should be used when the input is a group
      average surface - group average surfaces have significantly less surface
      area than individual surfaces do, and therefore distances measured on
      them would be smaller than measuring them on individual surfaces.  In

      metric column will have zeros outside the geodesic distance spacified by
      <limit>, and by default will have a value of 1.0 inside it.  If the
      -gaussian option is specified, the values inside the ROI will instead
      form a gaussian with the specified value of sigma, normalized so that the
      sum of the nonzero values in the metric column is 1.0.  The <method>
      argument to -overlap-logic must be one of ALLOW, CLOSEST, or EXCLUDE.
      ALLOW is the default, and means that ROIs are treated independently and
      may overlap.  CLOSEST means that ROIs may not overlap, and that no ROI
      contains vertices that are closer to a different seed vertex.  EXCLUDE
      means that ROIs may not overlap, and that any vertex within range of more
      than one ROI does not belong to any ROI.

      Resample cifti data to a different brainordinate space.  Use COLUMN for
      the direction to resample dscalar, dlabel, or dtseries.  Resampling both
      dimensions of a dconn requires running this command twice, once with
      COLUMN and once with ROW.  If you are resampling a dconn and your machine
      has a large amount of memory, you might consider using
      -cifti-resample-dconn-memory to avoid writing and rereading an
      intermediate file.  The <template-direction> argument should usually be
      COLUMN, as dtseries, dscalar, and dlabel all have brainordinates on that
      direction.  If spheres are not specified for a surface structure which
      exists in the cifti files, its data is copied without resampling or
      dilation.  Dilation is done with the 'nearest' method, and is done on
      <new-sphere> for surface data.  Volume components are padded before
      dilation so that dilation doesn't run into the edge of the component
      bounding box.  If neither -affine nor -warpfield are specified, the
      identity transform is assumed for the volume data.

      The recommended resampling methods are ADAP_BARY_AREA and CUBIC (cubic
      spline), except for label data which should use ADAP_BARY_AREA and
      ENCLOSING_VOXEL.  Using ADAP_BARY_AREA requires specifying an area option
      to each used -*-spheres option.

      The <volume-method> argument must be one of the following:

      CUBIC
      ENCLOSING_VOXEL
      TRILINEAR

      The <surface-method> argument must be one of the following:

      ADAP_BARY_AREA
      BARYCENTRIC

            <new-area> - a metric file with vertex areas for the new mesh

      This command does the same thing as running -cifti-resample twice, but
      uses memory up to approximately 2x the size that the intermediate file
      would be.  This is because the intermediate dconn is kept in memory,
      rather than written to disk, and the components before and after
      resampling/dilation have to be in memory at the same time during the
      relevant computation.  The <template-direction> argument should usually
      be COLUMN, as dtseries, dscalar, and dlabel all have brainordinates on
      that direction.  If spheres are not specified for a surface structure
      which exists in the cifti files, its data is copied without resampling or
      dilation.  Dilation is done with the 'nearest' method, and is done on
      <new-sphere> for surface data.  Volume components are padded before
      dilation so that dilation doesn't run into the edge of the component
      bounding box.

      The <volume-method> argument must be one of the following:

      CUBIC
      ENCLOSING_VOXEL
      TRILINEAR

      The <surface-method> argument must be one of the following:

      ADAP_BARY_AREA
      BARYCENTRIC

      The input cifti file must have a brain models mapping on the chosen
      dimension, columns for .dtseries, and either for .dconn.  By default,
      data in different structures is smoothed independently (i.e., "parcel
      constrained" smoothing), so volume structures that touch do not smooth
      across this boundary.  Specify -merged-volume to ignore these boundaries.
      Surface smoothing uses the GEO_GAUSS_AREA smoothing method.

      The -*-corrected-areas options are intended for when it is unavoidable to
      smooth on group average surfaces, it is only an approximate correction
      for the reduction of structure in a group average surface.  It is better
      to smooth the data on individuals before averaging, when feasible.

      The -fix-zeros-* options will treat values of zero as lack of data, and
      not use that value when generating the smoothed values, but will fill
      zeros with extrapolated values.  The ROI should have a brain models
      mapping along columns, exactly matching the mapping of the chosen
      direction in the input file.  Data outside the ROI is ignored.

      or -sum must be specified.

      Using -sum with -spatial-weights (or with -cifti-weights and a cifti
      containing weights of similar meaning) is equivalent to integrating with
      respect to area and volume.  When the input is binary ROIs, this will
      therefore output the area or volume of each ROI.

      NIFTI world matrices can be used directly on mm coordinates via matrix
      multiplication, they use the NIFTI coordinate system, that is, positive X
      is right, positive Y is anterior, and positive Z is superior.  Note that
      wb_command assumes that world matrices transform source coordinates to
      target coordinates, while other tools may use affines that transform
      target coordinates to source coordinates.

      The ITK format is used by ANTS.

      You must specify exactly one -from option, but you may specify multiple
      -to options, and -to-flirt may be specified more than once.

      NIFTI world warpfields can be used directly on mm coordinates via

      values to the coordinate vector.  They use the NIFTI coordinate system,
      that is, X is left to right, Y is posterior to anterior, and Z is
      inferior to superior.

      NOTE: this command does not invert the warpfield, and to warp a surface,
      you must use the inverse of the warpfield that warps the corresponding
      volume.

      The ITK format is used by ANTS.

      You must specify exactly one -from option, but you may specify multiple
      -to options, and -to-fnirt may be specified more than once.

      [-winding] - winding method for point inside surface test
         <method> - name of the method (default EVEN_ODD)

      Computes the signed distance function of the surface.  Exact distance is
      calculated by finding the closest point on any surface triangle to the
      center of the voxel.  Approximate distance is calculated starting with
      these distances, using dijkstra's method with a neighborhood of voxels.
      Specifying too small of an exact distance may produce unexpected results.
      Valid specifiers for winding methods are as follows:

      EVEN_ODD (default)
      NEGATIVE
      NONZERO
      NORMALS

      The NORMALS method uses the normals of triangles and edges, or the
      closest triangle hit by a ray from the point.  This method may be
      slightly faster, but is only reliable for a closed surface that does not
      cross through itself.  All other methods count entry (positive) and exit
      (negative) crossings of a vertical ray from the point, then counts as
      inside if the total is odd, negative, or nonzero, respectively.

      This would change the current label with key '3' to use the key '5'
      instead, 5 would use 8, and 8 would use 2.  Any collision in key values
      results in the label that was not specified in the remap file getting
      remapped to an otherwise unused key.  Remapping more than one key to the
      same new key, or the same key to more than one new key, results in an

      Resamples a label file, given two spherical surfaces that are in
      register.  If ADAP_BARY_AREA is used, exactly one of -area-surfs or
      -area-metrics must be specified.

      The ADAP_BARY_AREA method is recommended for label data, because it
      should be better at resolving vertices that are near multiple labels, or
      in case of downsampling.  Midthickness surfaces are recommended for the
      vertex areas for most data.

      The -largest option results in nearest vertex behavior when used with
      BARYCENTRIC, as it uses the value of the source vertex that has the
      largest weight.

      When -largest is not specified, the vertex weights are summed according
      to which label they correspond to, and the label with the largest sum is
      used.

      The <method> argument must be one of the following:

      ADAP_BARY_AREA
      BARYCENTRIC

      <surface> - the surface to use for distance information
      <metric-in> - the metric to find the extrema of
      <distance> - the minimum distance between identified extrema of the same
         type
      <metric-out> - output - the output extrema metric

      [-presmooth] - smooth the metric before finding extrema
         <kernel> - the sigma for the gaussian smoothing kernel, in mm

      [-roi] - ignore values outside the selected area
         <roi-metric> - the area to find extrema in, as a metric

      [-threshold] - ignore small extrema
         <low> - the largest value to consider for being a minimum
         <high> - the smallest value to consider for being a maximum

      [-sum-columns] - output the sum of the extrema columns instead of each
         column separately

      [-consolidate-mode] - use consolidation of local minima instead of a
         large neighborhood

      [-only-maxima] - only find the maxima

      [-only-minima] - only find the minima

      [-column] - select a single column to find extrema in
         <column> - the column number or name

      Finds extrema in a metric file, such that no two extrema of the same type
      are within <distance> of each other.  The extrema are labeled as -1 for
      minima, 1 for maxima, 0 otherwise.  If -only-maxima or -only-minima is
      specified, then it will ignore extrema not of the specified type.  These
      options are mutually exclusive.

      If -roi is specified, not only is data outside the roi not used, but any
      vertex on the edge of the ROI will never be counted as an extrema, in
      case the ROI cuts across a gradient, which would otherwise generate
      extrema where there should be none.

      If -sum-columns is specified, these extrema columns are summed, and the
      output has a single column with this result.

      By default, a datapoint is an extrema only if it is more extreme than
      every other datapoint that is within <distance> from it.  If
      -consolidate-mode is used, it instead starts by finding all datapoints
      that are more extreme than their immediate neighbors, then while there
      are any extrema within <distance> of each other, take the two extrema
      closest to each other and merge them into one by a weighted average based
      on how many original extrema have been merged into each.

      By default, all input columns are used with no smoothing, use -column to
      specify a single column to use, and -presmooth to smooth the input before
      finding the extrema.

COMPARE CORRELATION LOCALLY AND ACROSS/THROUGH SULCI/GYRI
   wb_command -metric-false-correlation
      <surface> - the surface to compute geodesic and 3D distance with
      <metric-in> - the metric to correlate
      <3D-dist> - maximum 3D distance to check around each vertex
      <geo-outer> - maximum geodesic distance to use for neighboring
         correlation
      <geo-inner> - minimum geodesic distance to use for neighboring
         correlation
      <metric-out> - output - the output metric

      [-roi] - select a region of interest that has data
         <roi-metric> - the region, as a metric file

      [-dump-text] - dump the raw measures used to a text file
         <text-out> - the output text file

      For each vertex, compute the average correlation within a range of
      geodesic distances that don't cross a sulcus/gyrus, and the correlation
      to the closest vertex crossing a sulcus/gyrus.  A vertex is considered to
      cross a sulcus/gyrus if the 3D distance is less than a third of the
      geodesic distance.  The output file contains the ratio between these
      correlations, and some additional maps to help explain the ratio.
