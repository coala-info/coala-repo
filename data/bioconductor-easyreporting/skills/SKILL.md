description: The easyreporting package provides an R6-based interface to simplify the real-time creation and management of Rmarkdown reports during an analysis. Use when user asks to initialize a report instance, add markdown headers or text, document code chunks, track variable assignments, or compile analysis steps into a reproducible document.

# bioconductor-easyreporting

## Overview

The `easyreporting` package provides an R6-based interface to simplify the creation of Rmarkdown reports. It acts as a wrapper that tracks your analysis steps in real-time, allowing you to append titles, text, code chunks, and variable states to a report file as you work. It is particularly useful for bioinformatics pipelines where documenting data provenance and specific function calls (including sourced scripts) is critical for reproducibility.

## Core Workflow

### 1. Initialization
Create an `easyreporting` instance to manage the report state. This defines the output path and metadata.

```r
library(easyreporting)

# Define project path and initialize
proj_path <- file.path(tempdir(), "my_analysis_report")
er <- easyreporting(filenamePath=proj_path, 
                    title="Analysis Report", 
                    author="Analyst Name")
```

### 2. Adding Structure and Text
Use these functions to add narrative context between code blocks.

*   `mkdTitle(er, title="Section Name", level=1)`: Adds a markdown header (levels 1-6).
*   `mkdGeneralMsg(er, "Your descriptive text here")`: Adds a paragraph of text.

### 3. Adding Code Chunks
There are three primary ways to include code in the report:

**A. Complete Chunks (Recommended)**
Best for single function calls or simple assignments.
```r
mkdCodeChunkComplete(er, code="data <- read.csv('data.csv')")
```

**B. Commented Chunks**
Adds a natural language comment immediately preceding the code.
```r
mkdCodeChunkCommented(er, 
                     comment="Normalize the counts using log2", 
                     code="norm_counts <- log2(counts + 1)")
```

**C. Manual Chunks**
Use for complex blocks where you need to track variable assignments manually.
```r
mkdCodeChunkSt(er) # Start chunk
# ... run your R code ...
mkdVariableAssignment(er, "result_var", result_val, show=TRUE)
mkdCodeChunkEnd(er) # End chunk
```

### 4. Advanced Features
*   **Sourcing External Scripts:** Use the `sourceFilesList` argument in chunk functions to copy and source external `.R` files into the report environment.
*   **Custom Options:** Use `makeOptionsList(echoFlag=TRUE, cacheFlag=TRUE)` to control Rmarkdown chunk behavior (e.g., `echo`, `include`, `cache`).

### 5. Compiling the Report
Once the analysis is complete, compile the tracked content into the final document (usually HTML via `distill`). This automatically appends `sessionInfo()`.

```r
compile(er)
```

## Tips for Effective Reporting
*   **Variable Tracking:** Use `mkdVariableAssignment` to explicitly document the value of a parameter used in the analysis within the report text.
*   **Path Management:** `easyreporting` handles the copying of sourced scripts to the report directory to ensure the final Rmd is self-contained.
*   **Level Consistency:** Start with `level=1` for main chapters and `level=2` or `3` for sub-steps like "Data Cleaning" or "Visualization".
