# retrosynthesis

## Overview

This workflow automates the retrosynthetic discovery of metabolic pathways, enabling researchers to identify biochemical routes from a target molecule back to a set of available precursors. By integrating a Genome-Scale Metabolic Model (GEM) in SBML format and a target InChI string, the pipeline searches for viable enzymatic transformations within a user-defined maximal pathway length.

The core of the process utilizes [RetroRules](https://retrorules.org/) for reaction rule sets and [RetroPath2.0](https://github.com/brsynth/RetroPath2) to perform the retrosynthetic search. The workflow begins by extracting a "sink" of available metabolites from the GEM and defining the source molecule, then executes the search to generate a scope of possible reactions and compounds.

In the final stages, the workflow employs [RP2paths](https://github.com/brsynth/rp2paths) to enumerate individual pathways and [rpReader](https://github.com/brsynth/rpReader) to convert these results into SBML format. The process concludes with [rpCofactors](https://github.com/brsynth/rpCofactors), which completes the chemical equations by adding necessary cofactors, providing a standardized set of SBML pathways ready for flux balance analysis or strain design.

## Inputs and data preparation

| Step | Label | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | GEM SBML | data_input |  |
| 1 | Target InChI | parameter_input |  |
| 3 | Maximal Pathway Length | parameter_input |  |


Ensure the GEM SBML file is in a valid XML format and the target molecule is provided as a standard InChI string to ensure compatibility with the RetroPath2.0 engine. While the primary inputs are individual datasets, you may utilize Galaxy collections to manage the multiple SBML pathways generated in the final steps. For streamlined execution, use `planemo workflow_job_init` to generate a `job.yml` file for defining your runtime parameters. Refer to the README.md for comprehensive details on specific tool configurations and chemical constraints.

## How to run (Planemo)

### Local Galaxy (default engine)

```bash
planemo run Galaxy-Workflow-RetroSynthesis.ga job.yml --download_outputs --output_directory . --output_json output.json
```

Optional: `--galaxy_root /path/to/galaxy` speeds up spinning up a local Galaxy.

### Docker Galaxy

Append e.g. `--engine docker_galaxy --ignore_dependency_problems` (requires Docker).

### External Galaxy (usegalaxy.org / EU / …)

```bash
planemo run Galaxy-Workflow-RetroSynthesis.ga job.yml --engine external_galaxy --galaxy_url SERVER_URL --galaxy_user_key YOUR_API_KEY
```

Create a reusable profile: `planemo profile_create myprofile --galaxy_url ... --galaxy_user_key ... --engine external_galaxy` then `planemo run Galaxy-Workflow-RetroSynthesis.ga job.yml --profile myprofile`.

### Job file

- Generate a template: `planemo workflow_job_init Galaxy-Workflow-RetroSynthesis.ga -o job.yml`
- Lint: `planemo workflow_lint Galaxy-Workflow-RetroSynthesis.ga`

See **[Running Galaxy workflows](https://planemo.readthedocs.io/en/master/running.html)** in the Planemo documentation.

## Invocation outputs

After a successful run with `--download_outputs`, files appear under your chosen `--output_directory`. `--output_json` records CWL-style metadata for outputs (paths, checksums).

On an external Galaxy, use `planemo invocation_download INVOCATION_ID --profile ...` to fetch outputs, or track progress with `planemo workflow_track INVOCATION_ID`.

Workflow steps marked as **workflow outputs** in the editor are listed under **Workflow outputs**; exact filenames depend on tools and Galaxy configuration.
