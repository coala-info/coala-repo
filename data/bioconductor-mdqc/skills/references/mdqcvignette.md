The process of producing microarray data involves multiple steps, some of which may suffer from
technical problems and seriously damage the quality of the data. Thus, it is essential to identify those
arrays with low quality. Our Mahalanobis Distance Quality Control (MDQC) is a multivariate quality
assessment method for microarrays that is based on the similarity of quality measures across arrays,
i.e., on the idea of outlier detection. Intuitively, the “distance” of an array’s quality attributes measures
the similarity of the quality of that array against the quality of the other arrays. Then, arrays with
unusually high distances can be flagged as potentially low-quality. This method computes a distance
measure, the Mahalanobis Distance, to summarize the quality measures contained in a quality control
(QC) report for each array. The use of this distance allows us to take the correlation structure of the
quality measures into account. In addition, by using robust estimators to identify the typical quality
measures of good-quality arrays, the evaluation is not affected by the measures of outlying arrays.

We show that computing these distances on subsets of the quality measures contained in the QC report
may increase the method’s ability to detect unusual arrays and helps to identify possible reasons of the
quality problems. Thus, while MDQC can be based on all the quality measures simultaneously (using
method="nogroups" in mdqc function), it is usually recommended to compute the MDs on subsets of
them (using method="apriori", "cluster", or "loading"), or on a transformed space with a lower
dimension (using method="global").
In the "apriori" approach the user forms groups of quality
measures on the basis of an a priori interpretation of them and according to the quality aspect they
represent. The "cluster" and the "loading" methods are two data-driven methods to form the groups.
The former groups the quality measures using clustering analysis, and the latter uses the loadings of
a robust principal component analysis (PCA) to identify the quality measures that contain similar
It is important to note that the "apriori", the "cluster", and the
information and group them.
"loading" methods create groups of the original quality measures of the report and compute one MD

within each group. Finally, the "global" method computes a single MD based on the reduced space of
the first k principal components from a robust PCA. The number k of PCs can be chosen using a scree
plot. A robust PCA and the associated biplot and scree plot can be obtained using the prcomp.robust
function in this package. More details on each method are given in Cohen Freue et al. (2007).

The resulting MDs can be used to flag poor-quality arrays as their MDs will be large relative to those of
undamaged arrays, i.e., they will be far from the center of the normal arrays. Under usual distributional
assumptions, the squared MDs have an approximate Chi-Squared distribution with p degrees of freedom.
Thus, using the Chi-Squared distribution we can set a cutoff point to decide if the array is likely to be
defective.

Before illustrating the performance of MDQC, we end with some remarks about MDQC. First, it is
important to note that although we use MDQC in the context of quality assessment of microarrays,
most of the methodologies implemented by MDQC have been widely used in Statistics to detect outliers.
Thus, although we illustrate our method using two data sets of Affymetrix GeneChips and their QC
reports, all the ideas can be applied to other platforms and/or QC reports as well as for outlier detection
outside microarray data. Second, MDQC can only be used if the number of observations (n) is greater
than or equal to the number of quality measures in the group (p). Thus, if p>n, the user needs to
divide the quality measures into groups (see the apriori, clustering or loading PCA grouping methods
in the paper Cohen Freue et al. (2007)) so that each group contains less variables than observations.
Otherwise, other PCA methods have to be applied to reduce the dimensionality of the data set (see
Huber et al. (2002)). Finally, as in any robust estimation method, caution should be taken when MDQC
is applied to data sets with small number of arrays. In these cases, the robust estimators of location
and covariance matrix may not be properly scaled damaging the performance of MDQC.

2 Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Study

To evaluate the performance of MDQC, we use part of an acute lymphoblastic leukemia study described
in Ross et al. (2003), containing 20 Affymetrix HG-U133Bmicroarrays (see the allQC help file for
more details on this data set). However, MDQC can be used on any QC report for other types of
microarrays. Bolstad et al. (2005) and Brettschneider et al. (2007) examined the quality of these
arrays using histograms of probe-level data, MA-plots and probe-level model methods described in
Bioconductor’s affyPLM package. According to their quality assessment, array 2 has a strong spatial
artifact on the chip and array 14 presents other evidence of poor quality.

As it was previously mentioned, when the number of quality measures is smaller than the number of
observations, one can perform a multivariate analysis using MDQC based on all the quality measures
in the report.

Figure 1 shows that using this MDQC approach array 14 is flagged as having potential quality problems
and array 2 appears only as a borderline case. In other words, collapsing all the quality measures into
a single MD downweights array 2’s quality problems and masks other outlying observations in the QC
report, such as those of arrays 1, 7 or 8. Thus, we study the MDs on groups with a reduced number of
variables. These alternative methods reduce the possibility of masking outliers and may give information
about the potential source of the quality problem.

Based on the interpretation of the quality measures in the QC report, the user may want to group these
measures into the following three groups:

1. Scale Factor, % Present, Avg BG, Min BG, Max BG

2. BioB, BioC, BioD, CreX

3. AFFX-HSAC07/X00351.3’/5’, GapDH

one case to another. The solid, dashed and dotted lines correspond to the square root of the 90th, 95th
and 99th percentile of the Chi-Squared distribution, respectively. Outlying arrays are identified using
solid points.

This MDQC approach, referred as the a priori grouping method, examines one MD for each array
and each group. It is important to recall that each group can not contain more quality measures than
arrays.

In Group 1, arrays 2 and 14 are both flagged as potentially defective, and array 17 as a borderline case.
In Group 2, array 1 has a MD exceeding the 99% cutoff and arrays 7 and 14 have MDs exceeding the

lower dimension flag both arrays 2 and 14, which is consistent with the results in Bolstad et al. (2005)
and Brettschneider et al. (2007).
In addition, arrays 1 and 8 are flagged as potentially low quality
and arrays 7 and 17 as borderline quality. Moreover, based on the interpretability of the groups, the
problems in array 2 are most likely due to defects in the chip as this array is only identified in Group
1. Similarly, since arrays 1 and 14 are flagged in Group 2, their low quality is most likely due to low
quality of the sample. Note that although array 14 is also flagged in Group 1, this can be still due
to quality problems in the sample. Finally, array 8 is flagged only in Group 3, suggesting potential
problems in the RNA quality.

While in the apriori grouping method, the groups are created by the user, the clustering grouping
method and the loading PCA grouping method are two data-driven methods used to create the
groups of quality measures used to compute the MDs. The clustering grouping method uses the
Partitioning Around Medoids (pam) clustering algorithm based on the distance constructed from the
correlation matrix (i.e., the distance between two variables x and y is given by d(x,y)=(1-cor(x,y))/2)
to group the quality measures of the QC report. As the data set may contain outlying observation,
using the distance based on the robust estimator of the correlation matrix as a dissimilarity measure
makes it more robust. We use the S-estimator (Lopuhaä (1989)) with 25% breakdown point to estimate
the correlation matrix of the quality measures. This estimator has demonstrated a good performance
in studies with small number of arrays, however, other robust estimators can be used (e.g., MCD).
Although in this method the user can choose the number of clusters (k), the number of returned quality
measures in each group (cluster) can not exceed the number of arrays in the study. If so, the user needs
to increase the number of clusters.

The loading PCA grouping method uses a robust PCA to group the quality measures in the report
according to their contribution to the first k principal components. As each loading vector derived
from a robust PCA shows the contribution of each quality variable to the first k PCs, these vectors can
be used to group the quality variables based on the similarity of their contribution to the model. We
can apply a clustering method, such as pam-algorithm or a hierarchical clustering method, to group

method, the number of quality measures in each group (cluster) can not exceed the number of arrays
in the study. Thus, if this is the case, the user needs to increase the number of clusters (k) used in the
loading space. For more details on the robust PCA, see the prcomp.robust function in this package and
Cohen Freue et al. (2007).

It is interesting to see that this approach leads to the same groups as the clustering grouping method,
as given in Figure 3.

Finally, we examine the performance of MDQC using the global PCA method to reduce the dimen-
sionality of the data. MDQC performs a robust PCA which requires more observations (arrays) than
variables (quality measures). If this is not the case, the user needs to apply other PCA methods (see
for example Huber et al. (2002)) or group the variables using previously described methods. Using the
scree plot, we retain k = 4 principal components in this analysis. Figure 4 shows the results of the

MDQC when a single MD is calculated based on the first 4 principal components derived from a robust
PCA based on robustly standardized data (see Cohen Freue et al. (2007) for more details). We note
that this approach still flags arrays 2, 8 and 14 as having potential quality problems. However, the first
two appear only as borderline cases. In addition, arrays 1, 7 and 17 are still masked using this method.

The previous example shows that all five approaches of MDQC (i.e., all variables, a priori, clustering,
loading and global PCA) identify the problematic arrays 2 and 14. However, the a priori grouping
method outstands the problem of array 2, unmasks other potentially low quality arrays and provides
possible explanations of the quality problems.

In summary, MDQC has a clear statistical foundation, it performs a robust multivariate analysis of the
quality measures provided in the QC report while taking into account their correlation structure, it is
easy to apply, and it is computationally lightweight. These properties make MDQC a useful diagnostic
technique suitable for large data sets.
