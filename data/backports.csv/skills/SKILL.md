description: The backports.csv tool provides Python 2 environments with the Python 3 CSV module's native Unicode support and improved handling logic. Use when user asks to handle Unicode CSV files in Python 2, migrate CSV code from Python 3 to legacy systems, or use DictReader and DictWriter with international datasets.

# backports.csv

## Overview

The `backports.csv` skill enables Python 2 environments to utilize the superior CSV handling logic found in Python 3. The primary issue with the standard Python 2 `csv` module is its lack of native Unicode support, as it expects 8-bit bytes. This backport allows you to work with Unicode strings directly, ensuring consistency when migrating code between Python versions or handling international datasets in legacy systems.

## Installation

Install the package via pip:

```bash
pip install backports.csv
```

## Implementation Patterns

### Correct Import
To use the backport, ensure you are importing from the `backports` namespace rather than the standard library:

```python
from backports import csv
```

### File Handling with io.open
The most critical best practice when using `backports.csv` is pairing it with `io.open`. This mimics the Python 3 `open` behavior, allowing you to specify encodings and newline handling.

**Reading CSVs:**
Always use `newline=''` as the `csv` module performs its own universal newline handling.

```python
import io
from backports import csv

def read_unicode_csv(filepath):
    with io.open(filepath, mode='r', newline='', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        reader = csv.reader(f)
        for row in reader:
            # row contains unicode strings
            yield row
```

**Writing CSVs:**
Ensure the file is opened in write mode with the appropriate encoding.

```python
import io
from backports import csv

def write_unicode_csv(filepath, data):
    with io.open(filepath, mode='w', newline='', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        writer = csv.writer(f)
        for row in data:
            writer.writerow(row)
```

## Expert Tips

*   **Binary Objects:** If you are forced to work with a binary file-like object instead of a file path, wrap the object in `io.TextIOWrapper` to provide the text interface the module expects.
*   **DictReader/DictWriter:** The backport includes the full Python 3 API, including `csv.DictReader` and `csv.DictWriter`, which are highly recommended for readability when headers are present.
*   **Dialect Safety:** It is safe to specify `newline=''` in the `open` call; the `backports.csv` module is designed to handle the line endings internally to prevent double-spacing issues on Windows.
