## Overview

`kpop` is a scalable bioinformatics suite designed to transform genomic sequences into low-dimensional vectors (embeddings) based on their k-mer spectra. By representing sequences as points in an abstract space, it allows for the rapid comparison of hundreds of thousands of assembled genomes or thousands of unassembled samples. Use this skill to perform sequence classification, estimate genomic relatedness, or build pseudo-phylogenetic trees without the computational overhead of traditional sequence alignment.

## Core Commands and Workflow

The `kpop` workflow typically follows a sequence of counting, database creation, and transformation (twisting).

### 1. K-mer Counting (`KPopCount`)
Generates k-mer spectra from FASTA/FASTQ files.
- **Basic Usage**: `KPopCount -k <size> -f "" <input.fasta> -o <output_prefix> -v`
- **Tip**: Use a small `k` (e.g., 5 or 6) for broad comparative tasks.

### 2. Database Management (`KPopCountDB`)
Aggregates counts and associates them with metadata/labels.
- **Basic Usage**: `KPopCountDB -i <count_dir> -m <metadata.txt> -c <column_name> -o <output_file>`
- **Metadata Format**: Usually a tab-delimited file mapping sequence IDs to classes.

### 3. Dimensionality Reduction (`KPopTwist`)
Transforms high-dimensional k-mer counts into embeddings.
- **Basic Usage**: `KPopTwist -i <input_db> -o <model_prefix> -v`
- **Piping**: Often used in a pipeline: `KPopCountDB ... | KPopTwist -i /dev/stdin -o <model_prefix>`

### 4. Classification and Querying (`KPopTwistDB`)
Compares new samples against an existing model or database.
- **Basic Usage**: `KPopTwistDB -i T <model_prefix> -t <query_counts> -d <model_prefix> <output_prefix> -v`

## Common CLI Patterns

### Efficient Classification Pipeline
To classify a set of test sequences using a trained model:
```bash
KPopCount -k 5 -f "" Test.fasta -o /dev/stdout | \
KPopTwistDB -i T TrainedModel -t /dev/stdin -d TrainedModel ResultsOutput -v
```

### Analyzing Results
The summary file (`.KPopSummary.txt`) contains the classification results. You can extract misclassified sequences using standard Unix tools:
```bash
cat Results.KPopSummary.txt | awk -F '\t' '{if ($2 != $6) print $0}'
```

## Expert Tips

- **Memory Management**: `kpop` is designed for scalability. If working with massive datasets, ensure you have sufficient RAM for the embedding space, though it is significantly more efficient than alignment-based methods.
- **I/O Optimization**: Use `/dev/stdout` and `/dev/stdin` to chain `KPopCount`, `KPopCountDB`, and `KPopTwist` commands. This prevents the creation of large intermediate files on disk.
- **Low Diversity Samples**: `kpop` excels at finding signal in datasets with very low genomic diversity (e.g., outbreaks of a single pathogen strain) where traditional SNPs might be sparse.
- **Dependencies**: Ensure `R` packages `data.table` and `ca` are installed, as some legacy components of the pipeline rely on them for specific statistical transformations.
