## Overview

Minimap2 is a high-performance, versatile pairwise aligner for genomic and spliced nucleotide sequences. It is the industry standard for mapping long-read sequencing data but remains highly competitive for short-read mapping and whole-genome comparisons. This skill provides the necessary command-line patterns and presets to execute various alignment workflows, from basic read mapping to complex splice-aware alignments.

## Common CLI Patterns

### Basic Mapping and Alignment
By default, minimap2 produces approximate mapping in Pairwise Mapping Format (PAF). Use the `-a` flag to generate full alignments in SAM format.

*   **Generate approximate mappings (PAF):**
    `minimap2 ref.fa query.fq > alignment.paf`
*   **Generate full alignments (SAM):**
    `minimap2 -a ref.fa query.fq > alignment.sam`
*   **Generate CIGAR strings in PAF output:**
    `minimap2 -c ref.fa query.fq > alignment.paf`

### Using Presets (-x)
Minimap2 uses presets to optimize parameters for specific data types. This is the recommended way to run the tool.

| Data Type | Preset | Command Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Nanopore Genomic** | `map-ont` | `minimap2 -ax map-ont ref.fa reads.fq > aln.sam` |
| **PacBio HiFi/CCS** | `map-hifi` | `minimap2 -ax map-hifi ref.fa reads.fq > aln.sam` |
| **PacBio CLR** | `map-pb` | `minimap2 -ax map-pb ref.fa reads.fq > aln.sam` |
| **Short Reads (Illumina)** | `sr` | `minimap2 -ax sr ref.fa r1.fq r2.fq > aln.sam` |
| **Spliced Long Reads** | `splice` | `minimap2 -ax splice ref.fa rna_reads.fa > aln.sam` |
| **Asm-to-Asm (<5% div)** | `asm5` | `minimap2 -cx asm5 ref.fa query.fa > aln.paf` |
| **Nanopore Overlaps** | `ava-ont` | `minimap2 -x ava-ont reads.fq reads.fq > ovlp.paf` |

### Indexing for Performance
For large reference genomes (e.g., Human), create an index first to save time in subsequent runs. Note that indexing parameters (k-mer size, etc.) are fixed once the index is built.

1.  **Create index:** `minimap2 -d ref.mmi ref.fa`
2.  **Map against index:** `minimap2 -a ref.mmi query.fq > aln.sam`

## Expert Tips

*   **Multi-threading:** Use `-t [INT]` to specify the number of CPU threads. Minimap2 scales very well with thread count.
*   **Input Formats:** Minimap2 natively supports gzip-compressed FASTA and FASTQ files. There is no need to decompress files before mapping.
*   **Spliced Alignment:** When mapping Nanopore direct RNA-seq, use `-ax splice -uf -k14` to account for the specific noise profile and k-mer requirements.
*   **Large CIGAR Operations:** If an alignment has more than 65,535 CIGAR operations (common in very long reads or structural variations), SAM format is required as the standard BAM format cannot store these natively without specific workarounds.
*   **Junction Support:** For RNA-seq, you can provide annotated splice junctions using `--junc-bed=anno.bed12` to improve mapping accuracy at known introns.
