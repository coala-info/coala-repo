# perl-test-fork

## Overview

The `perl-test-fork` skill facilitates testing asynchronous or multi-process Perl code. In standard Perl testing environments, forking a process usually causes the test counter to become desynchronized because both the parent and child attempt to claim the same test numbers. This tool provides a wrapper that temporarily suspends test numbering and manages a "sub-plan" for the child process, ensuring that the final test output remains valid and readable by TAP (Test Anything Protocol) consumers.

## Usage and Best Practices

### Installation
The package can be installed via Bioconda or CPAN:
```bash
# Via Conda
conda install bioconda::perl-test-fork

# Via CPAN
cpanm Test::Fork
```

### Basic Implementation
To use the tool, import `Test::Fork` alongside `Test::More`. Use the `fork_ok` function to encapsulate code intended for the child process.

```perl
use Test::More tests => 3;
use Test::Fork;

# fork_ok( $num_tests_in_child, sub { ... } )
fork_ok(2, sub {
    ok(1, "First child test");
    is($foo, $bar, "Second child test");
});

pass("Parent test continues here");
```

### Key Functional Details
- **Sub-plans**: The first argument to `fork_ok` is the number of tests expected within the anonymous subroutine. This acts as a mini-plan for the child.
- **Process Reaping**: `Test::Fork` automatically reaps child processes. You do not need to manually call `wait` or `waitpid` for children spawned via `fork_ok`.
- **Return Value**: `fork_ok` returns the PID of the child process to the parent, or false if the fork failed.
- **Test Counting**: The `fork_ok` call itself counts as one test in the parent's perspective (checking if the fork succeeded), but the tests *inside* the block do not increment the parent's main counter.

### Expert Tips and Caveats
- **Alpha Status**: Be aware that the implementation is considered alpha. It is highly effective for simple process coordination but may behave unexpectedly in complex nested fork scenarios.
- **Failure Detection**: A significant limitation is that the parent process cannot easily detect the failure of a test inside the child process via standard `Test::Builder` mechanisms. Always check the exit status or use shared memory/pipes if the parent must react to child test failures.
- **Test Numbering**: The module explicitly turns off test numbering during the child's execution to avoid collisions. If you are using custom test harnesses that rely strictly on sequential numbering during execution, verify compatibility.
- **Execution**: Run your tests using the standard Perl test runner to see the coordinated output:
  ```bash
  prove -v t/my_fork_test.t
  ```
