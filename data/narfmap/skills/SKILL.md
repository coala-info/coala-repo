# narfmap

## Overview
NARFMAP is an open-source, high-efficiency mapper and aligner derived from the Illumina DRAGMAP project. It is designed to provide the speed and accuracy of the Dragen alignment algorithm in a software-only format. This tool is particularly useful for researchers needing a fast, hardware-agnostic alternative to proprietary alignment solutions while maintaining compatibility with standard genomic data formats.

## Installation and Requirements

### System Requirements
*   **Architecture**: x86_64.
*   **Memory**: Minimum 64GB RAM (required for loading large reference indexes).
*   **OS**: Linux (CentOS 7+ or equivalent).

### Installation Methods
*   **Conda (Recommended)**:
    ```bash
    conda install -c bioconda narfmap
    ```
*   **Nix**:
    ```bash
    nix build github:bioinformaticsorphanage/NARFMAP
    ```
*   **Source**:
    Requires C++17, GNU Make >= 3.82, and Boost >= 1.69.
    ```bash
    make
    # Binary is generated in ./build/release/narfmap
    sudo make install
    ```

## Usage Patterns

### Reference Indexing
Before alignment, you must generate a hash table (index) for your reference genome.
*   Ensure you have sufficient disk space and RAM.
*   The process typically involves pointing the tool to a FASTA file to generate the proprietary index format used by the Dragen algorithm.

### Alignment Execution
The primary command for mapping reads is `dragen-os` (or `narfmap` depending on the specific build/version symlink).
*   **Input**: FASTQ files (paired-end or single-end).
*   **Output**: SAM/BAM format.
*   **Key Parameters**:
    *   `--ref-dir`: Path to the directory containing the pre-computed hash table.
    *   `-1`, `-2`: Paths to the input FASTQ files for paired-end data.
    *   `--num-threads`: Specify CPU cores to utilize for parallel processing.

## Expert Tips
*   **Unit Testing**: If building from source, you can skip the time-consuming unit tests by passing `HAS_GTEST=0` to the make command.
*   **Library Paths**: If you encounter issues with Boost or GTest during source compilation, manually set `BOOST_ROOT` or `GTEST_ROOT` in your environment variables before running `make`.
*   **Memory Management**: Because NARFMAP loads the entire reference index into memory, ensure no other memory-intensive processes are running on the node to prevent OOM (Out of Memory) kills.
