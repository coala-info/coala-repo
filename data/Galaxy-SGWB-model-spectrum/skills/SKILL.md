# SGWB model spectrum

## Overview

This workflow is designed to model the Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background (SGWB) spectrum, providing a streamlined approach for calculating the energy density of gravitational waves from astrophysical sources. It utilizes the [sgwb_astro_tool](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/astroteam/sgwb_astro_tool/) to generate theoretical spectra based on user-defined parameters for binary populations and cosmic evolution.

The process automates the complex calculations required to estimate the contribution of unresolved gravitational wave sources across different frequency bands. By leveraging the Galaxy framework, the workflow ensures that the modeling of these signals is reproducible and easily integrated into larger astrophysical data analysis pipelines.

For detailed information on parameter configurations, input requirements, and specific model assumptions, please refer to the [README.md](./README.md) file located in the Files section. This tool is part of the [astroteam](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/astroteam/sgwb_astro_tool) repository, focused on providing robust resources for gravitational wave astronomy.

## Inputs and data preparation

_None listed._


Ensure all input parameters are provided in tabular or JSON format to correctly interface with the astrophysical modeling tool. When analyzing multiple parameter sets or model variations, organize your data into dataset collections to simplify batch processing within the workflow. Consult the accompanying README.md for exhaustive documentation on specific physical constants and expected data structures. You may also use `planemo workflow_job_init` to create a `job.yml` file for streamlined configuration and automated execution.

_No explicit workflow outputs in this export; add outputs in the Galaxy editor or inspect tool steps._

## How to run (Planemo)

### Local Galaxy (default engine)

```bash
planemo run Galaxy-Workflow-SGWB_model_spectrum.ga job.yml --download_outputs --output_directory . --output_json output.json
```

Optional: `--galaxy_root /path/to/galaxy` speeds up spinning up a local Galaxy.

### Docker Galaxy

Append e.g. `--engine docker_galaxy --ignore_dependency_problems` (requires Docker).

### External Galaxy (usegalaxy.org / EU / …)

```bash
planemo run Galaxy-Workflow-SGWB_model_spectrum.ga job.yml --engine external_galaxy --galaxy_url SERVER_URL --galaxy_user_key YOUR_API_KEY
```

Create a reusable profile: `planemo profile_create myprofile --galaxy_url ... --galaxy_user_key ... --engine external_galaxy` then `planemo run Galaxy-Workflow-SGWB_model_spectrum.ga job.yml --profile myprofile`.

### Job file

- Generate a template: `planemo workflow_job_init Galaxy-Workflow-SGWB_model_spectrum.ga -o job.yml`
- Lint: `planemo workflow_lint Galaxy-Workflow-SGWB_model_spectrum.ga`

See **[Running Galaxy workflows](https://planemo.readthedocs.io/en/master/running.html)** in the Planemo documentation.

## Invocation outputs

After a successful run with `--download_outputs`, files appear under your chosen `--output_directory`. `--output_json` records CWL-style metadata for outputs (paths, checksums).

On an external Galaxy, use `planemo invocation_download INVOCATION_ID --profile ...` to fetch outputs, or track progress with `planemo workflow_track INVOCATION_ID`.

Workflow steps marked as **workflow outputs** in the editor are listed under **Workflow outputs**; exact filenames depend on tools and Galaxy configuration.
