description: This workflow processes tabular museum collection data and English stop words using text mining tools, Datamash, and visualization utilities to generate bar charts and word clouds. Use this skill when you need to analyze cultural heritage datasets to identify which years contributed the most items to a collection and visualize the most frequent object descriptions.

# visualise-amount-of-objects-in-museum-collection

## Overview

This Galaxy workflow is designed for text mining museum collection data provided in tabular format. It enables researchers to process raw cultural heritage data to identify temporal trends and characterize the nature of the collection. The pipeline requires two primary inputs: the museum dataset and a list of English stop words to refine text analysis.

The data undergoes a series of cleaning and transformation steps using tools such as [Filter Tabular](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/filter_tabular/filter_tabular/3.3.1) and [Column Regex Find And Replace](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/galaxyp/regex_find_replace/regexColumn1/1.0.3). By utilizing [Datamash](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/datamash_ops/datamash_ops/1.9+galaxy0) for aggregation, the workflow calculates the frequency of objects across different years, helping to pinpoint which periods are most represented in the collection.

The final outputs provide a comprehensive visual summary of the data. A bar chart displays the volume of objects over time, while a [word cloud](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/bgruening/wordcloud/wordcloud/1.9.4+galaxy2) visualizes the most frequent terms found in object descriptions. This workflow is particularly suited for [culturedata](https://usegalaxy.eu/training-material/topics/statistics/tutorials/text-mining/tutorial.html) analysis and is shared under a [CC-BY-4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license.

## Inputs and data preparation

| Step | Label | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Input | data_input | Upload a tsv file with multiple rows and columns to compute on. |
| 1 | stop_words_english | data_input | Upload a list of English stop words in a .txt-format. |


Ensure the museum collection is uploaded as a tabular file (TSV or CSV) and the stop words as a plain text file. Since the workflow relies on specific column indices for text mining and filtering, verify your data structure against the README.md for precise configuration details. You should provide these as individual datasets rather than collections to match the expected input format. For automated execution or testing, you can use `planemo workflow_job_init` to generate a template `job.yml` file.

## How to run (Planemo)

### Local Galaxy (default engine)

```bash
planemo run Galaxy-Workflow-Visualise_amount_of_objects_in_Museum_Collection.ga job.yml --download_outputs --output_directory . --output_json output.json
```

Optional: `--galaxy_root /path/to/galaxy` speeds up spinning up a local Galaxy.

### Docker Galaxy

Append e.g. `--engine docker_galaxy --ignore_dependency_problems` (requires Docker).

### External Galaxy (usegalaxy.org / EU / …)

```bash
planemo run Galaxy-Workflow-Visualise_amount_of_objects_in_Museum_Collection.ga job.yml --engine external_galaxy --galaxy_url SERVER_URL --galaxy_user_key YOUR_API_KEY
```

Create a reusable profile: `planemo profile_create myprofile --galaxy_url ... --galaxy_user_key ... --engine external_galaxy` then `planemo run Galaxy-Workflow-Visualise_amount_of_objects_in_Museum_Collection.ga job.yml --profile myprofile`.

### Job file

- Generate a template: `planemo workflow_job_init Galaxy-Workflow-Visualise_amount_of_objects_in_Museum_Collection.ga -o job.yml`
- Lint: `planemo workflow_lint Galaxy-Workflow-Visualise_amount_of_objects_in_Museum_Collection.ga`

See **[Running Galaxy workflows](https://planemo.readthedocs.io/en/master/running.html)** in the Planemo documentation.

## Invocation outputs

After a successful run with `--download_outputs`, files appear under your chosen `--output_directory`. `--output_json` records CWL-style metadata for outputs (paths, checksums).

On an external Galaxy, use `planemo invocation_download INVOCATION_ID --profile ...` to fetch outputs, or track progress with `planemo workflow_track INVOCATION_ID`.

Workflow steps marked as **workflow outputs** in the editor are listed under **Workflow outputs**; exact filenames depend on tools and Galaxy configuration.
