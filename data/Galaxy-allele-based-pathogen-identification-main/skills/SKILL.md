name: allele-based-pathogen-identification
description: This workflow performs allele-based pathogen identification by mapping preprocessed Nanopore reads to a reference genome using minimap2, calling variants with Clair3, and generating consensus sequences and coverage statistics with bcftools and samtools. Use this skill when you need to identify novel pathogen strains, track emerging variants through SNP analysis, or calculate mapping depth and coverage for foodborne pathogen detection.

# allele-based-pathogen-identification

## Overview

This workflow facilitates allele-based pathogen identification by detecting Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) to track emerging variants and the evolutionary histories of homogeneous strains. It is specifically designed for microbiome analysis, focusing on variant calling and consensus building to elucidate discrepancies between samples and reference sequences.

The pipeline processes preprocessed Nanopore sequencing reads by mapping them to a reference genome using [minimap2](https://github.com/lh3/minimap2). Variant calling is performed via [Clair3](https://github.com/HKU-BAL/Clair3), followed by VCF normalization with `bcftools` and quality filtering using `SnpSift`. The workflow concludes by generating consensus sequences and calculating comprehensive mapping metrics, including mean depth and coverage percentages per sample.

Developed under the [microGalaxy](https://microgalaxy.usegalaxy.eu/) and [IWC](https://github.com/galaxyproject/iwc) initiatives, this tool provides essential data for foodborne pathogen detection and tracking. For practical examples and step-by-step instructions using test datasets, users can refer to the associated [GTN tutorial](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/microbiome/tutorials/pathogen-detection-from-nanopore-foodborne-data/tutorial.html).

## Inputs and data preparation

| Step | Label | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | collection_of_preprocessed_samples | data_collection_input | Output collection from the Nanopore Preprocessing workflow |
| 1 | samples_profile | parameter_input | based on the lab preparation of the samples during sequencing, there should be a sample profile better than the other, to be chosen as an optional input to Minimap2. e.g. PacBio/Oxford Nanpore  For more details check: https://github.com/lh3/minimap2?tab=readme-ov-file#use-cases |
| 2 | reference_genome_of_tested_strain | data_input | Can be built in the tool later |


Ensure your input reads are organized into a list collection of `fastqsanger` or `fastqsanger.gz` files, while the reference genome should be provided as a single FASTA dataset. The workflow requires a specific samples profile parameter to correctly associate metadata during the variant calling and consensus building process. For automated execution and job configuration, you can initialize a template using `planemo workflow_job_init` to generate a `job.yml` file. Refer to the `README.md` for comprehensive details on file formatting and specific parameter requirements. Detailed step-by-step guidance and example data are also available in the linked GTN tutorial.

## How to run (Planemo)

### Local Galaxy (default engine)

```bash
planemo run Allele-based-Pathogen-Identification.ga job.yml --download_outputs --output_directory . --output_json output.json
```

Optional: `--galaxy_root /path/to/galaxy` speeds up spinning up a local Galaxy.

### Docker Galaxy

Append e.g. `--engine docker_galaxy --ignore_dependency_problems` (requires Docker).

### External Galaxy (usegalaxy.org / EU / …)

```bash
planemo run Allele-based-Pathogen-Identification.ga job.yml --engine external_galaxy --galaxy_url SERVER_URL --galaxy_user_key YOUR_API_KEY
```

Create a reusable profile: `planemo profile_create myprofile --galaxy_url ... --galaxy_user_key ... --engine external_galaxy` then `planemo run Allele-based-Pathogen-Identification.ga job.yml --profile myprofile`.

### Job file

- Generate a template: `planemo workflow_job_init Allele-based-Pathogen-Identification.ga -o job.yml`
- Lint: `planemo workflow_lint Allele-based-Pathogen-Identification.ga`

See **[Running Galaxy workflows](https://planemo.readthedocs.io/en/master/running.html)** in the Planemo documentation.

## Invocation outputs

After a successful run with `--download_outputs`, files appear under your chosen `--output_directory`. `--output_json` records CWL-style metadata for outputs (paths, checksums).

On an external Galaxy, use `planemo invocation_download INVOCATION_ID --profile ...` to fetch outputs, or track progress with `planemo workflow_track INVOCATION_ID`.

Workflow steps marked as **workflow outputs** in the editor are listed under **Workflow outputs**; exact filenames depend on tools and Galaxy configuration.
