## Overview
Kaptive is a specialized bioinformatic tool designed to automate the typing of surface polysaccharide loci from bacterial genome sequences. It is the standard tool for identifying K (capsule) and O (lipopolysaccharide) antigen types in *Klebsiella pneumoniae* and *Acinetobacter baumannii*. By utilizing curated reference databases and the `minimap2` aligner, Kaptive identifies the best-matching locus in a query assembly, assesses the completeness of the gene cluster, and flags potential disruptions such as insertion sequences (IS) or missing genes.

## CLI Usage and Best Practices

### Core Command Modes
Kaptive 3 operates through three primary subcommands:
*   `assembly`: The main mode for typing surface polysaccharide loci from genome assemblies (FASTA format).
*   `extract`: Used to pull specific features or sequences from Kaptive reference databases.
*   `convert`: Used to transform Kaptive output files into different formats for downstream analysis.

### Common Assembly Typing Patterns
To perform standard typing, you must provide the assembly file and the relevant reference database(s).

**Basic Klebsiella K-locus typing:**
```bash
kaptive assembly --assembly genome.fasta --k_locus_db klebsiella_k_locus.gbk --out_prefix sample_output
```

**Simultaneous K and O locus typing:**
```bash
kaptive assembly -a genome.fasta -k klebsiella_k_db.gbk -o klebsiella_o_db.gbk -p sample_results
```

### Expert Tips for Interpretation
*   **Match Confidence:** Pay close attention to the "Match Confidence" column. 
    *   **Perfect:** 100% coverage and identity with no gaps or disruptions.
    *   **Very High/High:** Minor variations or expected polymorphisms.
    *   **Low/None:** Indicates a potentially novel locus or a highly fragmented assembly.
*   **Locus Disruptions:** Kaptive identifies internal stop codons or IS elements. A "Perfect" match can be downgraded if an IS element is detected within the locus, which may result in a non-functional phenotype.
*   **Database Selection:** Ensure you are using the correct species-specific database. Using a *Klebsiella* database on an *Acinetobacter* assembly will yield misleading results.
*   **Dependencies:** Kaptive requires `minimap2` to be available in your system PATH. If running from source, ensure `biopython` and `DNA Features Viewer` are installed.

### Database Management
Kaptive relies on curated GenBank (.gbk) files as databases. You can extract information from these using the `extract` command:
```bash
kaptive extract --database klebsiella_k_db.gbk --format fasta --feature gene
```
