## Overview
PhyloToAST (Phylogenetic Tools for Analysis, Species-level, and Training) is a suite of Python scripts designed to bridge the gap between general phylogenetic pipelines and specialized species-level insights. While it integrates closely with QIIME, it provides standalone utility for handling complex microbial datasets, especially those requiring high-performance computing (HPC) environments. Key capabilities include sophisticated data visualization, taxonomic mapping, and the ability to handle multiple primer sets to ensure a more accurate representation of microbial communities.

## Installation and Environment
PhyloToAST is a Python 2.7-based toolset (with ongoing community efforts for Python 3 compatibility). 
- **Installation**: Install via pip using `pip install phylotoast`.
- **Dependencies**: Ensure `biom-format` (>= 2.1.5), `scikit-bio`, `matplotlib` (>= 1.5.0), and `h5py` are available, as these are critical for BIOM v2.x parsing and visualization.

## Core CLI Scripts and Usage Patterns

### 1. Visualization and Plotting
PhyloToAST provides several scripts for generating publication-quality figures.
- **PCOA.py**: Used for generating 2D or 3D Principal Coordinates Analysis plots.
    - *Expert Tip*: Use the legend placement options and point size parameters to clean up crowded plots. It supports an option to suppress the legend entirely for cleaner 3D exports.
- **LDA.py**: Performs Linear Discriminant Analysis.
    - *Expert Tip*: Use the point size parameter to adjust the scale of features in the resulting plot.
- **KDE Graphs**: Useful for visualizing distribution density, particularly when addressing known `dtype` issues in older matplotlib versions.

### 2. BIOM Table Manipulation
- **transform_biom.py**: A versatile utility for converting or modifying BIOM files.
- **restrict_repset.py**: Essential after filtering a BIOM table. Use this to create a new OTU representative set file that matches only the entries remaining in your filtered BIOM table.
- **kraken-biom parsing**: Use the specific parsing options within the toolset to handle BIOM files generated from Kraken outputs.

### 3. Taxonomic Mapping
- **otu_to_tax.py / otu_to_tax_name.py**: These scripts map OTU IDs to their corresponding taxonomic strings.
    - *Best Practice*: When preparing data for iTol (Interactive Tree of Life), use these scripts to ensure OTU IDs are preserved or replaced with human-readable taxonomic names as required by your downstream visualization needs.

### 4. Analysis and Export
- **Core OTUs**: Use the `--table_fp` flag to output a list of core OTUs directly to a TSV file for easy import into spreadsheet software or R.
- **Multiple Primer Support**: When working with datasets sequenced using different primers, use PhyloToAST's specific workflows to merge data while minimizing primer-induced bias.

## Workflow Best Practices
- **HPC Integration**: The toolset is designed for cluster environments. When running large-scale analyses, leverage the built-in support for SLURM and PBS job schedulers.
- **Data Integrity**: Always run `restrict_repset.py` after any OTU filtering step to maintain consistency between your sequence data and your abundance tables.
- **iTol Integration**: If using iTol for tree visualization, use the provided export options to format your data, ensuring you decide whether to keep or strip OTU IDs early in the process.
