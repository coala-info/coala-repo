## Overview
TWILIGHT (Tall and Wide Alignments at High Throughput) is a high-performance alignment tool optimized for massive genomic and proteomic datasets. It employs a progressive alignment algorithm combined with tiling strategies and a divide-and-conquer approach to handle sequence counts and lengths that typically exceed the memory or time constraints of standard aligners. While it functions on CPU-only systems, it is built to leverage NVIDIA (CUDA) or AMD (HIP) GPUs for significant performance gains.

## Core CLI Usage

The primary interface for TWILIGHT requires an unaligned FASTA file and a guide tree in Newick format.

### Default Alignment
To perform a standard progressive alignment:
```bash
twilight -t <guide_tree.nwk> -s <unaligned.fasta> -o <output_alignment.fasta>
```

### Adding New Sequences
If you have an existing alignment and a tree that includes placements for new sequences, use the addition mode (available in v0.2.0+):
```bash
twilight -a -t <tree_with_placements.nwk> -s <new_sequences.fasta> -o <updated_alignment.fasta>
```

### Iterative Mode (No Guide Tree)
When a guide tree is unavailable, TWILIGHT utilizes a Snakemake-based iterative workflow to estimate the tree using external tools before aligning.
1. Ensure the iterative dependencies are installed via `installIterative.sh`.
2. Run the workflow through the provided Snakemake configuration in the `workflow/` directory.

## Expert Tips and Best Practices

- **Hardware Acceleration**: TWILIGHT automatically detects the best available compute backend (CPU, NVIDIA GPU, or AMD GPU) if built using the `buildTWILIGHT.sh` script. For maximum throughput on large datasets, ensure your environment has functional CUDA or HIP drivers.
- **Memory Management**: For "wide" alignments (sequences >10,000 bases), TWILIGHT's tiling strategy is essential. If you encounter memory issues on CPU, consider reducing the number of threads or moving the workload to a GPU with high VRAM.
- **Protein Alignment**: As of v0.2.0, protein support is available but continuously improving. When aligning proteins, ensure you are using the latest version (v0.2.3+) to benefit from recent bug fixes in profile size counting and median extraction.
- **Tree Flexibility**: The tool supports "Flexible Tree Support," allowing the input guide tree to contain more sequences than are present in the actual FASTA file. This is useful for aligning subsets of a larger phylogenetic study.
- **Gappy Columns**: TWILIGHT uses a novel heuristic to handle gappy columns efficiently. This makes it particularly robust for datasets with high indel rates or fragmented sequences.

## Installation Quick-Start

**Conda (Recommended for CPU/NVIDIA):**
```bash
conda install -c bioconda twilight
```

**From Source (Required for AMD GPU/HIP):**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TurakhiaLab/TWILIGHT.git
cd TWILIGHT
bash ./install/buildTWILIGHT.sh hip
```
