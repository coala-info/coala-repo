description: This transcriptomics workflow processes mRNA-Seq read collections and UCSC reference genomes using FastQC, Cutadapt, HISAT2, and featureCounts to generate gene-level count matrices. Use this skill when you need to quantify gene expression levels from raw sequencing data to prepare for downstream differential expression analysis and biological interpretation of infectious disease datasets.

# mrna-seq-by-covid-pipeline-counts

## Overview

This [Galaxy](https://usegalaxy.org/) workflow is designed as part of the [BY-COVID](https://by-covid.org/) project to process raw mRNA-Seq data into structured feature counts. It transforms raw sequencing reads into a format ready for downstream differential expression analysis using statistical frameworks such as limma, DESeq2, or edgeR. The pipeline requires a collection of mRNA-Seq reads and a corresponding [UCSC Genome](https://genome.ucsc.edu/) as primary inputs.

The processing sequence begins with initial quality control via [FastQC](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/), followed by adapter and quality trimming using [Cutadapt](https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/). After a second round of quality validation, the trimmed reads are aligned to the reference genome using [HISAT2](https://daehwankimlab.github.io/hisat2/). The resulting alignments are then quantified at the gene or feature level using [featureCounts](https://subread.sourceforge.net/featureCounts.html).

To ensure data integrity and library quality, the workflow integrates [RSeQC](http://rseqc.sourceforge.net/) tools to analyze read distribution and gene body coverage. All metrics from the preprocessing, alignment, and quantification steps are aggregated into a single, interactive [MultiQC](https://multiqc.info/) report. The final outputs include the feature count tables, feature lengths, and the comprehensive HTML quality report.

This workflow is licensed under GPL-3.0-or-later and is associated with the [Galaxy Training Network (GTN)](https://training.galaxyproject.org/) and the BY-COVID initiative. For detailed implementation notes and usage instructions, please refer to the README.md in the Files section.

## Inputs and data preparation

| Step | Label | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | mRNA-Seq Reads | data_collection_input | Input list of fastqsanger format sequencing data |
| 1 | UCSC Genome | data_input | Export of UCSC Genome, just the genes. |


To prepare for this workflow, ensure your mRNA-Seq reads are organized into a paired-end or single-end data collection (fastqsanger or fastqsanger.gz) and that your reference genome is provided in FASTA format. Using a data collection instead of individual datasets is essential for the parallel processing of multiple samples through the HISAT2 and featureCounts steps. For comprehensive guidance on parameter settings and metadata requirements, refer to the accompanying README.md file. You can also use `planemo workflow_job_init` to generate a `job.yml` file for automated execution and reproducible input mapping.

## How to run (Planemo)

### Local Galaxy (default engine)

```bash
planemo run galaxy-workflow-mrna-seq-by-covid-pipeline--counts.ga job.yml --download_outputs --output_directory . --output_json output.json
```

Optional: `--galaxy_root /path/to/galaxy` speeds up spinning up a local Galaxy.

### Docker Galaxy

Append e.g. `--engine docker_galaxy --ignore_dependency_problems` (requires Docker).

### External Galaxy (usegalaxy.org / EU / …)

```bash
planemo run galaxy-workflow-mrna-seq-by-covid-pipeline--counts.ga job.yml --engine external_galaxy --galaxy_url SERVER_URL --galaxy_user_key YOUR_API_KEY
```

Create a reusable profile: `planemo profile_create myprofile --galaxy_url ... --galaxy_user_key ... --engine external_galaxy` then `planemo run galaxy-workflow-mrna-seq-by-covid-pipeline--counts.ga job.yml --profile myprofile`.

### Job file

- Generate a template: `planemo workflow_job_init galaxy-workflow-mrna-seq-by-covid-pipeline--counts.ga -o job.yml`
- Lint: `planemo workflow_lint galaxy-workflow-mrna-seq-by-covid-pipeline--counts.ga`

See **[Running Galaxy workflows](https://planemo.readthedocs.io/en/master/running.html)** in the Planemo documentation.

## Invocation outputs

After a successful run with `--download_outputs`, files appear under your chosen `--output_directory`. `--output_json` records CWL-style metadata for outputs (paths, checksums).

On an external Galaxy, use `planemo invocation_download INVOCATION_ID --profile ...` to fetch outputs, or track progress with `planemo workflow_track INVOCATION_ID`.

Workflow steps marked as **workflow outputs** in the editor are listed under **Workflow outputs**; exact filenames depend on tools and Galaxy configuration.
