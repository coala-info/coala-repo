htmg430pmACCNUM

Map Manufacturer identifiers to Accession Numbers

Description

htmg430pmACCNUM is an R object that contains mappings between a manufacturer’s identifiers
and manufacturers accessions.

Details

For chip packages such as this, the ACCNUM mapping comes directly from the manufacturer. This
is different from other mappings which are mapped onto the probes via an Entrez Gene identifier.

Each manufacturer identifier maps to a vector containing a GenBank accession number.

Mappings were based on data provided by: Entrez Gene ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/DATA With
a date stamp from the source of: 2021-Apr14

htmg430pmALIAS2PROBE Map between Common Gene Symbol Identifiers and Manufacturer

Identifiers

Description

htmg430pmALIAS is an R object that provides mappings between common gene symbol identifiers
and manufacturer identifiers.

Details

Each gene symbol is mapped to a named vector of manufacturer identifiers. The name represents
the gene symbol and the vector contains all manufacturer identifiers that are found for that symbol.
An NA is reported for any gene symbol that cannot be mapped to any manufacturer identifiers.

This mapping includes ALL gene symbols including those which are already listed in the SYMBOL
map. The SYMBOL map is meant to only list official gene symbols, while the ALIAS maps are
meant to store all used symbols.

htmg430pmCHR

Map Manufacturer IDs to Chromosomes

Description

htmg430pmCHR is an R object that provides mappings between a manufacturer identifier and the
chromosome that contains the gene of interest.

Details

Each manufacturer identifier maps to a vector of chromosomes. Due to inconsistencies that may
exist at the time the object was built, the vector may contain more than one chromosome (e.g., the
identifier may map to more than one chromosome). If the chromosomal location is unknown, the
vector will contain an NA.

htmg430pmCHRLENGTHS

A named vector for the length of each of the chromosomes

Description

htmg430pmCHRLENGTHS provides the length measured in base pairs for each of the chromo-
somes.

Details

This is a named vector with chromosome numbers as the names and the corresponding lengths for
chromosomes as the values.

Total lengths of chromosomes were derived by calculating the number of base pairs on the sequence
string for each chromosome.

htmg430pmCHRLOC

Map Manufacturer IDs to Chromosomal Location

Description

htmg430pmCHRLOC is an R object that maps manufacturer identifiers to the starting position of
the gene. The position of a gene is measured as the number of base pairs.

The CHRLOCEND mapping is the same as the CHRLOC mapping except that it specifies the
ending base of a gene instead of the start.

htmg430pmENSEMBL

Details

5

Each manufacturer identifier maps to a named vector of chromosomal locations, where the name
indicates the chromosome. Due to inconsistencies that may exist at the time the object was built,
these vectors may contain more than one chromosome and/or location. If the chromosomal location
is unknown, the vector will contain an NA.

Chromosomal locations on both the sense and antisense strands are measured as the number of base
pairs from the p (5’ end of the sense strand) to q (3’ end of the sense strand) arms. Chromosomal
locations on the antisense strand have a leading "-" sign (e. g. -1234567).

Since some genes have multiple start sites, this field can map to multiple locations.

htmg430pmENSEMBL

Map Ensembl gene accession numbers with Entrez Gene identifiers

Description

htmg430pmENSEMBL is an R object that contains mappings between manufacturer identifiers and
Ensembl gene accession numbers.

Details

This object is a simple mapping of manufacturer identifiers to Ensembl gene Accession Numbers.
Mappings were based on data provided by BOTH of these sources: http://www.ensembl.org/
biomart/martview/ ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/DATA

For most species, this mapping is a combination of manufacturer to ensembl IDs from BOTH
NCBI and ensembl. Users who wish to only use mappings from NCBI are encouraged to see

6

htmg430pmENTREZID

the ncbi2ensembl table in the appropriate organism package. Users who wish to only use mappings
from ensembl are encouraged to see the ensembl2ncbi table which is also found in the appropriate
organism packages. These mappings are based upon the ensembl table which is contains data from
BOTH of these sources in an effort to maximize the chances that you will find a match.

For worms and flies however, this mapping is based only on sources from ensembl, as these organ-
isms do not have ensembl to entrez gene mapping data at NCBI.

htmg430pmENTREZID

Map between Manufacturer Identifiers and Entrez Gene

Description

htmg430pmENTREZID is an R object that provides mappings between manufacturer identifiers
and Entrez Gene identifiers.

htmg430pmENZYME

Details

7

Each manufacturer identifier is mapped to a vector of Entrez Gene identifiers. An NA is assigned to
those manufacturer identifiers that can not be mapped to an Entrez Gene identifier at this time.

If a given manufacturer identifier can be mapped to different Entrez Gene identifiers from various
sources, we attempt to select the common identifiers. If a concensus cannot be determined, we
select the smallest identifier.

htmg430pmENZYME

Maps between Manufacturer IDs and Enzyme Commission (EC) Num-
bers

Description

htmg430pmENZYME is an R object that provides mappings between manufacturer identifiers and
EC numbers. htmg430pmENZYME2PROBE is an R object that maps Enzyme Commission (EC)
numbers to manufacturer identifiers.

Details

When the htmg430pmENZYME maping viewed as a list, each manufacturer identifier maps to a
named vector containing the EC number that corresponds to the enzyme produced by that gene.
The names corresponds to the manufacturer identifiers. If this information is unknown, the vector
will contain an NA.

8

htmg430pmENZYME

For the htmg430pmENZYME2PROBE, each EC number maps to a named vector containing all of
the manufacturer identifiers that correspond to the gene that produces that enzyme. The name of
the vector corresponds to the EC number.

Enzyme Commission numbers are assigned by the Nomenclature Committee of the International
Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology http://www.chem.qmw.ac.uk/iubmb/enzyme/ to
allow enzymes to be identified.

An Enzyme Commission number is of the format EC x.y.z.w, where x, y, z, and w are numeric num-
bers. In htmg430pmENZYME2PROBE, EC is dropped from the Enzyme Commission numbers.

Enzyme Commission numbers have corresponding names that describe the functions of enzymes
in such a way that EC x is a more general description than EC x.y that in turn is a more general
description than EC x.y.z. The top level EC numbers and names are listed below:

EC 1 oxidoreductases

EC 2 transferases

EC 3 hydrolases

EC 4 lyases

EC 5 isomerases

EC 6 ligases
The EC name for a given EC number can be viewed at http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iupac/
jcbn/index.html#6

htmg430pmGENENAME

Map between Manufacturer IDs and Genes

Description

htmg430pmGENENAME is an R object that maps manufacturer identifiers to the corresponding
gene name.

Details

Each manufacturer identifier maps to a named vector containing the gene name. The vector name
corresponds to the manufacturer identifier. If the gene name is unknown, the vector will contain an
NA.
Gene names currently include both the official (validated by a nomenclature committee) and pre-
ferred names (interim selected for display) for genes. Efforts are being made to differentiate the
two by adding a name to the vector.

htmg430pmGO

htmg430pmGO

Maps between manufacturer IDs and Gene Ontology (GO) IDs

Description

htmg430pmGO is an R object that provides mappings between manufacturer identifiers and the GO
identifiers that they are directly associated with. This mapping and its reverse mapping (htmg430pmGO2PROBE)
do NOT associate the child terms from the GO ontology with the gene. Only the directly evidenced
terms are represented here.

htmg430pmGO2ALLPROBES is an R object that provides mappings between a given GO iden-
tifier and all of the manufacturer identifiers annotated at that GO term OR TO ONE OF IT’S
CHILD NODES in the GO ontology. Thus, this mapping is much larger and more inclusive than
htmg430pmGO2PROBE.

Details

If htmg430pmGO is cast as a list, each manufacturer identifier is mapped to a list of lists. The
names on the outer list are GO identifiers. Each inner list consists of three named elements: GOID,
Ontology, and Evidence.

The GOID element matches the GO identifier named in the outer list and is included for convenience
when processing the data using ’lapply’.

The Ontology element indicates which of the three Gene Ontology categories this identifier belongs
to. The categories are biological process (BP), cellular component (CC), and molecular function
(MF).

The Evidence element contains a code indicating what kind of evidence supports the association of
the GO identifier to the manufacturer id. Some of the evidence codes in use include:

IMP: inferred from mutant phenotype

IGI: inferred from genetic interaction

IPI: inferred from physical interaction

ISS: inferred from sequence similarity

IDA: inferred from direct assay

IEP: inferred from expression pattern

IEA: inferred from electronic annotation

TAS: traceable author statement

NAS: non-traceable author statement

ND: no biological data available

IC: inferred by curator

A more complete listing of evidence codes can be found at:
http://www.geneontology.org/GO.evidence.shtml

If htmg430pmGO2ALLPROBES or htmg430pmGO2PROBE is cast as a list, each GO term maps to
a named vector of manufacturer identifiers and evidence codes. A GO identifier may be mapped to
the same manufacturer identifier more than once but the evidence code can be different. Mappings
between Gene Ontology identifiers and Gene Ontology terms and other information are available in
a separate data package named GO.

htmg430pmGO

11

Whenever any of these mappings are cast as a data.frame, all the results will be output in an appro-
priate tabular form.

Mappings between manufacturer identifiers and GO information were obtained through their map-
pings to manufacturer identifiers. NAs are assigned to manufacturer identifiers that can not be
mapped to any Gene Ontology information. Mappings between Gene Ontology identifiers an Gene
Ontology terms and other information are available in a separate data package named GO.

All mappings were based on data provided by: Gene Ontology http://current.geneontology.org/ontology/go-
basic.obo With a date stamp from the source of: 2021-02-01

Description

DEPRECATED. Counts in the MAPCOUNT table are out of sync and should not be used.

htmg430pmMAPCOUNTS provides the "map count" (i.e. the count of mapped keys) for each map
in package htmg430pm.db.

Details

DEPRECATED. Counts in the MAPCOUNT table are out of sync and should not be used.

This "map count" information is precalculated and stored in the package annotation DB. This allows
some quality control and is used by the checkMAPCOUNTS function defined in AnnotationDbi to com-
pare and validate different methods (like count.mappedkeys(x) or sum(!is.na(as.list(x))))
for getting the "map count" of a given map.

htmg430pmORGANISM

The Organism information for htmg430pm

Description

htmg430pmORGANISM is an R object that contains a single item: a character string that names
the organism for which htmg430pm was built. htmg430pmORGPKG is an R object that contains
a chararcter vector with the name of the organism package that a chip package depends on for its
gene-centric annotation.

Details

Although the package name is suggestive of the organism for which it was built, htmg430pmORGANISM
provides a simple way to programmatically extract the organism name. htmg430pmORGPKG pro-
vides a simple way to programmatically extract the name of the parent organism package. The
parent organism package is a strict dependency for chip packages as this is where the gene cetric
information is ultimately extracted from. The full package name will always be this string plus the
extension ".db". But most programatic acces will not require this extension, so its more convenient
to leave it out.

htmg430pmPMID

Maps between Manufacturer Identifiers and PubMed Identifiers

Description

htmg430pmPMID is an R object that provides mappings between manufacturer identifiers and
PubMed identifiers. htmg430pmPMID2PROBE is an R object that provides mappings between
PubMed identifiers and manufacturer identifiers.

Details

When htmg430pmPMID is viewed as a list each manufacturer identifier is mapped to a named vec-
tor of PubMed identifiers. The name associated with each vector corresponds to the manufacturer
identifier. The length of the vector may be one or greater, depending on how many PubMed identi-
fiers a given manufacturer identifier is mapped to. An NA is reported for any manufacturer identifier
that cannot be mapped to a PubMed identifier.

When htmg430pmPMID2PROBE is viewed as a list each PubMed identifier is mapped to a named
vector of manufacturer identifiers. The name represents the PubMed identifier and the vector con-
tains all manufacturer identifiers that are represented by that PubMed identifier. The length of the

16

htmg430pmPMID

vector may be one or longer, depending on how many manufacturer identifiers are mapped to a
given PubMed identifier.

Titles, abstracts, and possibly full texts of articles can be obtained from PubMed by providing a
valid PubMed identifier. The pubmed function of annotate can also be used for the same purpose.

Maps between Manufacturer Identifiers and PROSITE Identifiers

Description

htmg430pmPROSITE is an R object that provides mappings between manufacturer identifiers and
PROSITE identifiers.

Details

The bimap interface for PROSITE is defunct. Please use select() interface to PROSITE identifiers.
See ?AnnotationDbi::select for details.

htmg430pmREFSEQ

Map between Manufacturer Identifiers and RefSeq Identifiers

Description

htmg430pmREFSEQ is an R object that provides mappings between manufacturer identifiers and
RefSeq identifiers.

Details

Each manufacturer identifier is mapped to a named vector of RefSeq identifiers. The name repre-
sents the manufacturer identifier and the vector contains all RefSeq identifiers that can be mapped
to that manufacturer identifier. The length of the vector may be one or greater, depending on how
many RefSeq identifiers a given manufacturer identifier can be mapped to. An NA is reported for
any manufacturer identifier that cannot be mapped to a RefSeq identifier at this time.

RefSeq identifiers differ in format according to the type of record the identifiers are for as shown
below:

NG\_XXXXX: RefSeq accessions for genomic region (nucleotide) records

NM\_XXXXX: RefSeq accessions for mRNA records

NC\_XXXXX: RefSeq accessions for chromosome records

NP\_XXXXX: RefSeq accessions for protein records

XR\_XXXXX: RefSeq accessions for model RNAs that are not associated with protein products

XM\_XXXXX: RefSeq accessions for model mRNA records

XP\_XXXXX: RefSeq accessions for model protein records

Where XXXXX is a sequence of integers.
NCBI https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/RefSeq/ allows users to query the RefSeq database us-
ing RefSeq identifiers.

Mappings were based on data provided by: Entrez Gene ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/DATA With

htmg430pmSYMBOL

Map between Manufacturer Identifiers and Gene Symbols

Description

htmg430pmSYMBOL is an R object that provides mappings between manufacturer identifiers and
gene abbreviations.

Details

Each manufacturer identifier is mapped to an abbreviation for the corresponding gene. An NA is
reported if there is no known abbreviation for a given gene.

Symbols typically consist of 3 letters that define either a single gene (ABC) or multiple genes
(ABC1, ABC2, ABC3). Gene symbols can be used as key words to query public databases such as
Entrez Gene.

htmg430pmUNIPROT

Map Uniprot accession numbers with Entrez Gene identifiers

Description

htmg430pmUNIPROT is an R object that contains mappings between the manufacturer identifiers
and Uniprot accession numbers.

Details

This object is a simple mapping of manufacturer identifiers to Uniprot Accessions.

Mappings were based on data provided by NCBI (link above) with an exception for fly, which
required retrieving the data from ensembl http://www.ensembl.org/biomart/martview/

htmg430pm_dbconn

htmg430pm_dbconn

Collect information about the package annotation DB

Description

Some convenience functions for getting a connection object to (or collecting information about) the
package annotation DB.

Usage

htmg430pm_dbconn()
htmg430pm_dbfile()
htmg430pm_dbschema(file="", show.indices=FALSE)
htmg430pm_dbInfo()

Arguments

file

A connection, or a character string naming the file to print to (see the file
argument of the cat function for the details).

show.indices

The CREATE INDEX statements are not shown by default. Use show.indices=TRUE
to get them.

Details

htmg430pm_dbconn returns a connection object to the package annotation DB. IMPORTANT: Don’t
call dbDisconnect on the connection object returned by htmg430pm_dbconn or you will break all
the AnnDbObj objects defined in this package!

htmg430pm_dbfile returns the path (character string) to the package annotation DB (this is an
SQLite file).

htmg430pm_dbschema prints the schema definition of the package annotation DB.

htmg430pm_dbInfo prints other information about the package annotation DB.

Value

htmg430pm_dbconn: a DBIConnection object representing an open connection to the package an-
notation DB.

htmg430pm_dbfile: a character string with the path to the package annotation DB.

htmg430pm_dbschema: none (invisible NULL).

htmg430pm_dbInfo: none (invisible NULL).
