# animal-dive-prediction-using-deep-learning

## Overview

This workflow implements a comprehensive deep learning pipeline designed to predict animal diving behavior based on movement data. It utilizes structured datasets including features and labels for training, validation, and testing. To address potential class imbalances in behavioral data, the workflow incorporates oversampled training sets and utilizes [sklearn_to_categorical](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/bgruening/sklearn_to_categorical) for label preprocessing.

The core of the analysis involves configuring and building multiple neural network architectures using [Keras model config](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/bgruening/keras_model_config) and [Keras model builder](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/bgruening/keras_model_builder). These models are then trained and evaluated through the [Keras training and evaluation](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/bgruening/keras_train_and_eval) tool, which allows for iterative refinement of the deep learning parameters to optimize prediction accuracy.

Following model training, the workflow performs extensive evaluation and prediction on unseen test data. It leverages [machine learning visualization](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/bgruening/ml_visualization_ex) extensions to interpret model performance and data distributions. Final outputs are refined through [table compute](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/table_compute) operations and data cleaning steps to produce clear, actionable predictions of animal dive patterns.

## Inputs and data preparation

| Step | Label | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | W1_val_labels.tsv | data_input |  |
| 1 | W1_te_labels.tsv | data_input |  |
| 2 | W1_te_features.tsv | data_input |  |
| 3 | W1_oversample_tr_labels.tsv | data_input |  |
| 4 | W1_oversample_tr_features.tsv | data_input |  |
| 5 | labels.tsv | data_input |  |


Ensure all input features and labels are uploaded as tabular (TSV) files, specifically separating training, validation, and test sets to match the deep learning model requirements. Since this workflow processes multiple distinct datasets for oversampling and evaluation, ensure each file is correctly assigned to its corresponding input port rather than using a collection. For automated execution and parameter mapping, you can use `planemo workflow_job_init` to generate a `job.yml` file. Refer to the `README.md` for comprehensive details on the specific column structures and preprocessing steps required for these animal dive datasets.

## Workflow outputs (marked in Galaxy)

_No explicit workflow outputs in this export; add outputs in the Galaxy editor or inspect tool steps._

## How to run (Planemo)

### Local Galaxy (default engine)

```bash
planemo run Galaxy-Workflow-Animal_dive_prediction_using_deep_learning.ga job.yml --download_outputs --output_directory . --output_json output.json
```

Optional: `--galaxy_root /path/to/galaxy` speeds up spinning up a local Galaxy.

### Docker Galaxy

Append e.g. `--engine docker_galaxy --ignore_dependency_problems` (requires Docker).

### External Galaxy (usegalaxy.org / EU / …)

```bash
planemo run Galaxy-Workflow-Animal_dive_prediction_using_deep_learning.ga job.yml --engine external_galaxy --galaxy_url SERVER_URL --galaxy_user_key YOUR_API_KEY
```

Create a reusable profile: `planemo profile_create myprofile --galaxy_url ... --galaxy_user_key ... --engine external_galaxy` then `planemo run Galaxy-Workflow-Animal_dive_prediction_using_deep_learning.ga job.yml --profile myprofile`.

### Job file

- Generate a template: `planemo workflow_job_init Galaxy-Workflow-Animal_dive_prediction_using_deep_learning.ga -o job.yml`
- Lint: `planemo workflow_lint Galaxy-Workflow-Animal_dive_prediction_using_deep_learning.ga`

See **[Running Galaxy workflows](https://planemo.readthedocs.io/en/master/running.html)** in the Planemo documentation.

## Invocation outputs

After a successful run with `--download_outputs`, files appear under your chosen `--output_directory`. `--output_json` records CWL-style metadata for outputs (paths, checksums).

On an external Galaxy, use `planemo invocation_download INVOCATION_ID --profile ...` to fetch outputs, or track progress with `planemo workflow_track INVOCATION_ID`.

Workflow steps marked as **workflow outputs** in the editor are listed under **Workflow outputs**; exact filenames depend on tools and Galaxy configuration.
