description: "This MGnify subworkflow processes paired-end amplicon reads through a rigorous quality control pipeline using fastp, SeqPrep for merging, Trimmomatic, and PRINSEQ to generate cleaned FASTA files and MultiQC reports. Use this skill when you need to prepare raw metagenomic marker gene sequences for taxonomic profiling by removing low-quality bases, filtering short or ambiguous reads, and merging overlapping paired-end fragments."

# MGnify's amplicon pipeline v5.0 - Quality control PE

## Overview

This Galaxy workflow implements the quality control subworkflow for [MGnify's amplicon pipeline v5.0](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/), specifically designed for paired-end Illumina reads. It processes raw sequence data through a rigorous multi-step cleaning process to ensure high-quality input for downstream taxonomic classification and metagenomic analysis.

The pipeline begins with initial quality and length filtering using [fastp](https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp), followed by the merging of overlapping paired-end reads into single longer sequences via a modified version of [SeqPrep](https://github.com/jstjohn/SeqPrep). Subsequent refinement is performed using [Trimmomatic](http://www.usadellab.org/cms/?page=trimmomatic) for sliding-window trimming and [PRINSEQ](http://prinseq.sourceforge.net/) for ambiguity filtering, ensuring that sequences with excessive "N" bases or insufficient length are removed.

Throughout the process, [FastQC](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) monitors data quality at multiple stages. The workflow concludes by converting the processed sequences into FASTA format and generating a comprehensive [MultiQC](https://multiqc.info/) report. This report aggregates statistics across all samples, providing a centralized overview of the filtering efficiency and final sequence quality.

This workflow is licensed under Apache-2.0 and is tagged for use in metagenomics and amplicon analysis within the microgalaxy community.

## Inputs and data preparation

| Step | Label | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Paired-end reads | data_collection_input | Paired-end reads collection. |
| 1 | fastp - Enable base correction | parameter_input | Enable base correction in overlapped regions. |
| 2 | fastp - Qualified quality phred | parameter_input | The quality value that a base is qualified. |
| 3 | fastp - Unqualified percent limit | parameter_input | How many percents of bases are allowed to be unqualified (0~100). |
| 4 | fastp - Length required | parameter_input | Reads shorter than this value will be discarded. |
| 5 | Trimmomatic - SLIDINGWINDOW - Number of bases to average across | parameter_input | Number of bases to average across. |
| 6 | Trimmomatic - SLIDINGWINDOW - Average quality required | parameter_input | Average quality required. |
| 7 | Trimmomatic - LEADING | parameter_input | Minimum quality required to keep a base. |
| 8 | Trimmomatic - TRAILING | parameter_input | Minimum quality required to keep a base. |
| 9 | Length filtering - Minimum size | parameter_input | Minimum sequence length. |
| 10 | Trimmomatic - MINLEN | parameter_input | Minimum length of reads to be kept. |
| 11 | Ambiguity filtering - Maximal N percentage threshold to conserve sequences | parameter_input | Maximal N percentage threshold to conserve sequences. |


For this subworkflow, provide your raw sequencing data as a paired list collection containing fastq or fastq.gz files to ensure proper handling of forward and reverse reads. You should adjust the fastp and Trimmomatic parameters, such as Phred quality thresholds and minimum length requirements, to match your specific library preparation and sequencing quality. Refer to the README.md for a comprehensive breakdown of all default parameter values and filtering logic. For automated execution and testing, you can initialize a job configuration using `planemo workflow_job_init` to generate a `job.yml` file.

## How to run (Planemo)

### Local Galaxy (default engine)

```bash
planemo run mgnify-amplicon-pipeline-v5-quality-control-paired-end.ga job.yml --download_outputs --output_directory . --output_json output.json
```

Optional: `--galaxy_root /path/to/galaxy` speeds up spinning up a local Galaxy.

### Docker Galaxy

Append e.g. `--engine docker_galaxy --ignore_dependency_problems` (requires Docker).

### External Galaxy (usegalaxy.org / EU / …)

```bash
planemo run mgnify-amplicon-pipeline-v5-quality-control-paired-end.ga job.yml --engine external_galaxy --galaxy_url SERVER_URL --galaxy_user_key YOUR_API_KEY
```

Create a reusable profile: `planemo profile_create myprofile --galaxy_url ... --galaxy_user_key ... --engine external_galaxy` then `planemo run mgnify-amplicon-pipeline-v5-quality-control-paired-end.ga job.yml --profile myprofile`.

### Job file

- Generate a template: `planemo workflow_job_init mgnify-amplicon-pipeline-v5-quality-control-paired-end.ga -o job.yml`
- Lint: `planemo workflow_lint mgnify-amplicon-pipeline-v5-quality-control-paired-end.ga`

See **[Running Galaxy workflows](https://planemo.readthedocs.io/en/master/running.html)** in the Planemo documentation.

## Invocation outputs

After a successful run with `--download_outputs`, files appear under your chosen `--output_directory`. `--output_json` records CWL-style metadata for outputs (paths, checksums).

On an external Galaxy, use `planemo invocation_download INVOCATION_ID --profile ...` to fetch outputs, or track progress with `planemo workflow_track INVOCATION_ID`.

Workflow steps marked as **workflow outputs** in the editor are listed under **Workflow outputs**; exact filenames depend on tools and Galaxy configuration.
