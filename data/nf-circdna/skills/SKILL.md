name: circdna
description: This pipeline identifies extrachromosomal circular DNAs (ecDNAs) from WGS, ATAC-seq, or Circle-Seq data provided via a samplesheet in FASTQ or BAM format, utilizing specific identification routes like Circle-Map, CIRCexplorer2, or AmpliconArchitect to produce junction calls and assembly reports. Use when analyzing eukaryotic cells for eccDNAs, microDNAs, or large amplified ecDNAs across different sequencing modalities where specialized detection of circular junctions or de novo assembly is required.

# circdna

## Overview
nf-core/circdna is a bioinformatics pipeline designed for the identification of extrachromosomal circular DNAs (ecDNAs) in eukaryotic cells. It addresses the biological challenge of detecting various circular DNA types, ranging from small eccDNAs and microDNAs to large, amplified circular amplicons, by integrating multiple specialized software tools into a single workflow.

The pipeline processes short-read sequencing data from WGS, ATAC-seq, or Circle-Seq experiments. Depending on the selected analysis branch, it can perform junction detection, identify circular amplicons, or conduct de novo assembly of circular sequences, providing researchers with comprehensive reports and quality control metrics.

## Data preparation
Users must provide a CSV samplesheet containing the paths to input files. The structure of the samplesheet depends on whether FASTQ or BAM files are used as input.

**FASTQ input format:**
```csv
sample,fastq_1,fastq_2
CONTROL_REP1,AEG588A1_S1_L002_R1_001.fastq.gz,AEG588A1_S1_L002_R2_001.fastq.gz
```

**BAM input format:**
```csv
sample,bam
CONTROL_REP1,AEG588A1_S1_L002_R1_001.bam
```

**Reference and Metadata Requirements:**
*   **Genome:** A reference genome must be specified using `--genome` (e.g., `GRCh38`) or a custom FASTA file with `--fasta`.
*   **AmpliconArchitect:** If using the `ampliconarchitect` identifier, you must provide the absolute path to the AmpliconArchitect data repository via `--aa_data_repo` and a directory containing the `mosek.lic` license file via `--mosek_license_dir`.
*   **Input Format:** The parameter `--input_format` must be set to either `'FASTQ'` or `'BAM'`.

## How to run
The pipeline is executed using `nextflow run`. You must specify the input samplesheet, the output directory, the reference genome, the input format, and the desired circular DNA identification algorithm.

```bash
nextflow run nf-core/circdna \
  --input samplesheet.csv \
  --outdir ./results \
  --genome GRCh38 \
  --input_format FASTQ \
  --circle_identifier circle_map_realign \
  -profile docker
```

**Key Parameters:**
*   `--circle_identifier`: Specifies the algorithm(s) to use. Options include `circle_map_realign`, `circle_map_repeats`, `circle_finder`, `circexplorer2`, `ampliconarchitect`, and `unicycler`. Multiple identifiers can be provided as a comma-separated list.
*   `-profile`: Defines the software container or environment (e.g., `docker`, `singularity`, `conda`).
*   `-resume`: Allows the pipeline to skip steps that have already been successfully completed in a previous run.

## Outputs
All results are stored in the directory specified by the `--outdir` parameter.

*   **MultiQC:** The `multiqc/` folder contains an HTML report aggregating quality control metrics from FastQC, Trim Galore!, and alignment steps. This is typically the first file to inspect.
*   **Identification Results:** Results from the selected circular DNA identifiers (e.g., Circle-Map, CIRCexplorer2) are located in their respective subdirectories within the output folder.
*   **BAM Files:** If requested via `--save_markduplicates_bam` or `--save_sorted_bam`, processed alignment files will be saved to the output directory.

For a comprehensive description of all output files and how to interpret them, refer to the official documentation at https://nf-co.re/circdna/output.
