description: Paraviewer generates an automated, self-contained website for visualizing Paraphase HiFi analysis results through interactive tables and integrated IGV.js tracks. Use when user asks to visualize Paraphase outputs, generate a web-based genomic viewer, or review haplotype-level data in a browser.

# paraviewer

## Overview

Paraviewer is an automated visualization generator specifically built for the Paraphase HiFi analysis tool. It transforms raw analysis outputs into a user-friendly, self-contained website featuring a powerful table viewer and integrated IGV.js visualizations. Use this skill to bridge the gap between command-line genomic analysis and visual data interpretation, especially for complex regions where haplotype-level review is critical.

## Installation and Setup

Install paraviewer via bioconda to ensure all dependencies are managed:

```bash
conda install bioconda::paraviewer
```

## Core Workflow

1. **Prepare Input**: Ensure you have a completed output directory from Paraphase or the PureTarget Carrier Panel (PTCP). This directory must contain the per-sample BAM, JSON, and VCF files.
2. **Generate Viewer**: Run the tool pointing to the Paraphase results.
3. **Review Results**: Open the generated `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Command Line Usage

The primary function of paraviewer is to ingest a directory and produce a website.

### Basic Execution
Run the tool by providing the input directory and specifying an output location for the website files:

```bash
paraviewer <paraphase_output_dir> --output <web_viewer_dir>
```

### Handling Trio Data
If the upstream Paraphase experiment included a pedigree file (.ped), paraviewer automatically detects this and generates specialized trio visualization rows in the output table. No additional flags are required if the pedigree information is present in the input directory metadata.

## Expert Tips and Best Practices

- **Browser Compatibility**: Always use Google Chrome to view the generated websites. Firefox is known to have compatibility issues with the IGV.js components used for dynamic track viewing.
- **Static vs. Dynamic Viewing**: 
    - Use the **static IGV screenshots** in the table for rapid "at-a-glance" variant confirmation.
    - Launch the **dynamic IGV.js window** for detailed haplotype inspection and manual curation.
- **Data Portability**: The output directory is a "serverless" website. You can move the entire output folder to a local machine or a shared drive and open the `index.html` without needing a web server (e.g., Apache or Nginx).
- **Filtering**: Utilize the filtering window at the bottom control bar of the generated site to isolate specific samples or regions, which is more efficient than manual scrolling in large cohorts.
- **BAM Access**: Use the download buttons within the table to retrieve regional BAM files and IGV session files for local desktop IGV review if the browser-based viewer is insufficient for complex structural variant analysis.
