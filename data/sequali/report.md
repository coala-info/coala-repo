               INPUT [INPUT_REVERSE]

Create a quality metrics report for sequencing data.

positional arguments:
  INPUT                 Input FASTQ or uBAM file. The format is autodetected
                        and compressed formats are supported.
  INPUT_REVERSE         Second FASTQ file for Illumina paired-end reads.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --json JSON           JSON output file. default: '<input>.json'.
  --html HTML           HTML output file. default: '<input>.html'.
  --outdir OUTDIR, --dir OUTDIR
                        Output directory for the report files. default:
                        current working directory.
  --images-zip ZIP      If supplied, will create a zip file with the images at
                        the supplied location.
  --adapter-file ADAPTER_FILE
                        File with adapters to search for. See default file for
                        formatting. Default: /usr/local/lib/python3.10/site-
                        packages/sequali/adapters/adapter_list.tsv.
  --overrepresentation-threshold-fraction FRACTION
                        At what fraction a sequence is determined to be
                        overrepresented. The threshold is calculated as
                        fraction times the number of sampled sequences.
                        Default: 0.001 (1 in 1,000).
  --overrepresentation-min-threshold THRESHOLD
                        The minimum amount of occurrences for a sequence to be
                        considered overrepresented, regardless of the bound
                        set by the threshold fraction. Useful for smaller
                        files. Default: 100.
  --overrepresentation-max-threshold THRESHOLD
                        The amount of occurrences for a sequence to be
                        considered overrepresented, regardless of the bound
                        set by the threshold fraction. Useful for very large
                        files. Default: unlimited.
  --overrepresentation-max-unique-fragments N
                        The maximum amount of unique fragments to store.
                        Larger amounts increase the sensitivity of finding
                        overrepresented sequences at the cost of increasing
                        memory usage. Default: 5,000,000.
  --overrepresentation-fragment-length LENGTH
                        The length of the fragments to sample. The maximum is
                        31. Default: 21.
  --overrepresentation-sample-every DIVISOR
                        How often a read should be sampled. More samples leads
                        to better precision, lower speed, and also towards
                        more bias towards the beginning of the file as the
                        fragment store gets filled up with more sequences from
                        the beginning. Default: 1 in 8.
  --overrepresentation-bases-from-start BP
                        The minimum amount of bases sampled from the start of
                        the read. There might be slight overshoot depending on
                        the fragment length. Set to a negative value to sample
                        the entire read. Default: 100
  --overrepresentation-bases-from-end BP
                        The minimum amount of bases sampled from the end of
                        the read. There might be slight overshoot depending on
                        the fragment length. Set to a negative value to sample
                        the entire read. Default: 100
  --duplication-max-stored-fingerprints N
                        Determines how many fingerprints are maximally stored
                        to estimate the duplication rate. More fingerprints
                        leads to a more accurate estimate, but also more
                        memory usage. Default: 1,000,000.
  --fingerprint-front-length LENGTH
                        Set the number of bases to be taken for the
                        deduplication fingerprint from the front of the
                        sequence. Default: 8.
  --fingerprint-back-length LENGTH
                        Set the number of bases to be taken for the
                        deduplication fingerprint from the back of the
                        sequence. Default: 8.
  --fingerprint-front-offset LENGTH
                        Set the offset for the front part of the deduplication
                        fingerprint. Useful for avoiding adapter sequences.
                        Default: 64 for single end, 0 for paired sequences.
  --fingerprint-back-offset LENGTH
                        Set the offset for the back part of the deduplication
                        fingerprint. Useful for avoiding adapter sequences.
                        Default: 64 for single end, 0 for paired sequences.
  -t THREADS, --threads THREADS
                        Number of threads to use. If greater than one an
                        additional thread for gzip decompression will be used.
                        Default: 2.
  --version             show program's version number and exit
