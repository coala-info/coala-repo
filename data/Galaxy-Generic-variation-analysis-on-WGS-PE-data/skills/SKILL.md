description: This workflow performs variant calling on paired-end whole genome sequencing data by integrating fastp for quality control, BWA-MEM for mapping, and LoFreq for sensitive detection of low-frequency alleles. Use this skill when you need to identify genetic polymorphisms, assess subclonal diversity, or characterize viral and bacterial evolution from raw sequencing reads using a GenBank reference.

# generic-variation-analysis-on-wgs-pe-data

## Overview

This workflow provides a comprehensive pipeline for genetic variation analysis using Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) paired-end data. It begins by preprocessing raw reads with [fastp](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/fastp/fastp/0.20.1+galaxy0) for quality control and trimming, while simultaneously using [SnpEff build](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/snpeff/snpEff_build_gb/4.3+T.galaxy4) to construct a custom genomic database from a provided GenBank reference.

Processed reads are aligned to the reference genome using [BWA-MEM](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/devteam/bwa/bwa_mem/0.7.17.1). The alignment is then refined through [Samtools](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/samtools_view/samtools_view/1.9+galaxy2) filtering and [Picard MarkDuplicates](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/devteam/picard/picard_MarkDuplicates/2.18.2.2) to remove PCR duplicates. [MultiQC](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/multiqc/multiqc/1.9+galaxy1) is utilized to aggregate preprocessing and mapping statistics into a single diagnostic report.

The core of the analysis involves sensitive variant calling via the [Lofreq](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/lofreq_call/lofreq_call/2.1.5+galaxy0) suite, which performs Viterbi realignment and indel quality insertion to detect variants across a wide range of allele frequencies. Finally, the identified variants are filtered and annotated for functional impact using [SnpEff](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/snpeff/snpEff/4.3+T.galaxy1).

This MIT-licensed workflow is tagged for generic use and specifically for MPXV (Monkeypox virus) analysis, offering a robust solution for identifying low-frequency variants in viral or small bacterial genomes.

## Inputs and data preparation

| Step | Label | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Paired Collection | data_collection_input | Illumina reads with fastqsanger encoding |
| 1 | GenBank genome | data_input |  |


Ensure your sequencing data is organized as a Paired Collection of FASTQ files and that your reference genome is in GenBank format to support both mapping and SnpEff database building. Using a collection instead of individual datasets streamlines the processing of multiple samples through the BWA-MEM and LoFreq pipeline. Refer to the README.md for comprehensive details on parameter settings and specific data requirements. You can use `planemo workflow_job_init` to generate a `job.yml` file for automated execution and reproducible input mapping.

## How to run (Planemo)

### Local Galaxy (default engine)

```bash
planemo run Galaxy-Workflow-Generic_variation_analysis_on_WGS_PE_data.ga job.yml --download_outputs --output_directory . --output_json output.json
```

Optional: `--galaxy_root /path/to/galaxy` speeds up spinning up a local Galaxy.

### Docker Galaxy

Append e.g. `--engine docker_galaxy --ignore_dependency_problems` (requires Docker).

### External Galaxy (usegalaxy.org / EU / …)

```bash
planemo run Galaxy-Workflow-Generic_variation_analysis_on_WGS_PE_data.ga job.yml --engine external_galaxy --galaxy_url SERVER_URL --galaxy_user_key YOUR_API_KEY
```

Create a reusable profile: `planemo profile_create myprofile --galaxy_url ... --galaxy_user_key ... --engine external_galaxy` then `planemo run Galaxy-Workflow-Generic_variation_analysis_on_WGS_PE_data.ga job.yml --profile myprofile`.

### Job file

- Generate a template: `planemo workflow_job_init Galaxy-Workflow-Generic_variation_analysis_on_WGS_PE_data.ga -o job.yml`
- Lint: `planemo workflow_lint Galaxy-Workflow-Generic_variation_analysis_on_WGS_PE_data.ga`

See **[Running Galaxy workflows](https://planemo.readthedocs.io/en/master/running.html)** in the Planemo documentation.

## Invocation outputs

After a successful run with `--download_outputs`, files appear under your chosen `--output_directory`. `--output_json` records CWL-style metadata for outputs (paths, checksums).

On an external Galaxy, use `planemo invocation_download INVOCATION_ID --profile ...` to fetch outputs, or track progress with `planemo workflow_track INVOCATION_ID`.

Workflow steps marked as **workflow outputs** in the editor are listed under **Workflow outputs**; exact filenames depend on tools and Galaxy configuration.

## Files

- `Galaxy-Workflow-Generic_variation_analysis_on_WGS_PE_data.ga` — Galaxy workflow export (JSON)
