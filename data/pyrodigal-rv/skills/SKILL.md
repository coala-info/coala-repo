# pyrodigal-rv

## Overview

pyrodigal-rv is a specialized extension of the Pyrodigal library designed specifically for gene prediction in RNA viruses. While standard Prodigal and Pyrodigal are optimized for bacteria and archaea, this tool substitutes those models with metagenomic models trained on RNA viruses. It is particularly effective for sequences within the Riboviria realm. By default, the tool operates in "meta" mode to handle the diverse genetic landscapes found in viral samples, supporting both the standard genetic code (translation table 1) and various alternative codes.

## CLI Usage Patterns

The command-line interface is designed to be a drop-in replacement for Prodigal/Pyrodigal but with viral-specific defaults.

### Basic Gene Prediction
To run gene prediction on a viral FASTA file and output both protein translations and nucleotide sequences:
```bash
pyrodigal-rv -i input_virus.fasta -a proteins.faa -d genes.fna
```

### Output Formats
Specify the output file for gene coordinates (defaults to a custom Prodigal format if not specified):
```bash
pyrodigal-rv -i input.fasta -o output.gff -f gff
```

### Single Genome Mode
While the tool defaults to meta mode (recommended for viruses), you can force single genome mode, though this reverts to standard Pyrodigal behavior:
```bash
pyrodigal-rv -i input.fasta -p single
```

## Python API Integration

For programmatic workflows, use the `ViralGeneFinder` class which manages the viral metagenomic models automatically.

```python
import Bio.SeqIO
import pyrodigal_rv

# Load sequence
record = Bio.SeqIO.read("virus.fasta", "fasta")

# Initialize finder (meta=True is recommended for viral models)
orf_finder = pyrodigal_rv.ViralGeneFinder(meta=True, viral_only=True)

# Predict genes
for i, pred in enumerate(orf_finder.find_genes(bytes(record.seq))):
    print(f">{record.id}_{i+1}")
    print(pred.translate())
```

## Expert Tips and Best Practices

*   **Meta Mode Default**: Unlike standard Prodigal, `pyrodigal-rv` runs in meta mode by default. This is intentional as RNA viruses often lack the genomic length required for the "single" mode training phase.
*   **Genetic Code Ambiguity**: The tool may occasionally struggle to distinguish between translation table 1 and table 11 because they share the same start and stop codons. If your results for families like *Spinareoviridae* look incorrect, manually verify the translation table.
*   **Viral Only Flag**: In the Python API, setting `viral_only=True` ensures the finder uses only the specialized viral models, excluding the standard bacterial models that might otherwise cause false positives in mixed samples.
*   **Benchmarking Context**: The tool has been validated against ~9,000 Riboviria RefSeq sequences. It significantly outperforms standard Pyrodigal and `pyrodigal-gv` (giant virus extension) for RNA virus gene discovery, particularly in reducing missing or extra CDS predictions.
*   **Installation**: The most reliable way to ensure all data files (models) are included is via PyPI (`pip install pyrodigal-rv`) or Bioconda (`conda install -c bioconda pyrodigal-rv`).
