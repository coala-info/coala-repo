# cromast-a-workflow-for-assessing-protein-domain-classificati

## Overview

CroMaSt (Cross-Mapper of domain Structural instances) is an automated Common Workflow Language (CWL) workflow designed to refine protein domain classifications. By integrating data from the [Pfam](http://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/Pfam/releases/Pfam35.0/) and [CATH](ftp://orengoftp.biochem.ucl.ac.uk/cath/releases/latest-release/cath-classification-data/) databases, the workflow identifies and cross-maps structural instances (StIs) to clarify the assignment of protein domains based on their 3D structures.

The workflow operates through an iterative process of structural alignment and ID mapping. It extracts residue-mapped domain instances from both databases, performs cross-mapping to identify unique or shared instances, and utilizes the [Kpax](http://kpax.loria.fr/) tool for structural comparison. This analysis allows the workflow to categorize structural instances into four distinct groups: **Core**, **True**, **Domain-like**, and **Failed**.

Users can initialize the process with specific Pfam or CATH family identifiers. If the workflow identifies new related family identifiers during an iteration, it generates a new parameter file to facilitate subsequent runs until the domain space is fully explored. The source code and implementation details are available in the [CroMaSt repository](https://gitlab.inria.fr/capsid.public_codes/CroMaSt.git).
