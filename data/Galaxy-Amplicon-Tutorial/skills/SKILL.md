# Amplicon Tutorial

## Overview

This workflow provides a comprehensive pipeline for the analysis of microbiome metagenomics data, specifically designed for amplicon sequencing. Following the [Galaxy Training Network (GTN)](https://training.galaxyproject.org/) standards, it processes soil samples—such as the provided Anguil and Pampa datasets—by comparing them against the SILVA reference database to generate a global taxonomic picture.

The pipeline relies heavily on the Mothur tool suite to perform rigorous sequence processing and quality control. Initial steps include merging files, dereplication via `unique.seqs`, and alignment to the SILVA reference. The data is further refined through screening, filtering, and pre-clustering to reduce sequencing noise and improve computational efficiency during taxonomic classification.

In the final stages, the workflow performs OTU clustering and generates essential community files, including a shared OTU table and a BIOM file. These results are integrated with [Krona](https://github.com/marbl/Krona/wiki) to produce interactive hierarchical visualizations, allowing researchers to explore the taxonomic composition and diversity of their environmental samples.

## Inputs and data preparation

| Step | Label | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | SILVA Reference | data_input |  |
| 1 | Anguil Soil Sample | data_input |  |
| 2 | Pampa Soil Sample | data_input |  |
| 3 | Trainset PDS alignment | data_input |  |
| 4 | Trainset PDS taxonomy | data_input |  |


Ensure the soil samples and reference files (SILVA, PDS) are uploaded in FASTA format with their corresponding taxonomy and alignment files correctly typed in Galaxy. While this workflow uses individual datasets for the Anguil and Pampa samples, organizing multiple samples into a dataset collection can streamline the merging and grouping steps for larger microbiome studies. Refer to the README.md for comprehensive details on data sources and specific tool parameters required for the Mothur suite. You can use `planemo workflow_job_init` to generate a `job.yml` file for efficiently mapping these inputs during command-line execution.

## How to run (Planemo)

### Local Galaxy (default engine)

```bash
planemo run amplicon.ga job.yml --download_outputs --output_directory . --output_json output.json
```

Optional: `--galaxy_root /path/to/galaxy` speeds up spinning up a local Galaxy.

### Docker Galaxy

Append e.g. `--engine docker_galaxy --ignore_dependency_problems` (requires Docker).

### External Galaxy (usegalaxy.org / EU / …)

```bash
planemo run amplicon.ga job.yml --engine external_galaxy --galaxy_url SERVER_URL --galaxy_user_key YOUR_API_KEY
```

Create a reusable profile: `planemo profile_create myprofile --galaxy_url ... --galaxy_user_key ... --engine external_galaxy` then `planemo run amplicon.ga job.yml --profile myprofile`.

### Job file

- Generate a template: `planemo workflow_job_init amplicon.ga -o job.yml`
- Lint: `planemo workflow_lint amplicon.ga`

See **[Running Galaxy workflows](https://planemo.readthedocs.io/en/master/running.html)** in the Planemo documentation.

## Invocation outputs

After a successful run with `--download_outputs`, files appear under your chosen `--output_directory`. `--output_json` records CWL-style metadata for outputs (paths, checksums).

On an external Galaxy, use `planemo invocation_download INVOCATION_ID --profile ...` to fetch outputs, or track progress with `planemo workflow_track INVOCATION_ID`.

Workflow steps marked as **workflow outputs** in the editor are listed under **Workflow outputs**; exact filenames depend on tools and Galaxy configuration.

## Files

- `amplicon.ga` — Galaxy workflow export (JSON)
- `job.yml` — inputs/parameters for `planemo run` (create with `planemo workflow_job_init`)
