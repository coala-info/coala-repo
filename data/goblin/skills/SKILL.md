## Overview
GOBLIN (Generate trusted prOteins to supplement BacteriaL annotatIoN) is a command-line tool that automates the creation of species-specific protein databases. It streamlines the process of querying NCBI, downloading GenBank files, extracting protein sequences, and clustering them to remove redundancy. This workflow ensures that downstream bacterial annotations are based on high-quality, representative data rather than generic or overly redundant sets.

## Command Line Usage

### Basic Syntax
The core requirement for any GOBLIN run is a query and an output prefix.
```bash
goblin --query "Organism Name" --prefix output_name
```

### Common Query Patterns
*   **By Organism Name**: `goblin --query "Staphylococcus aureus" --prefix saureus`
*   **By Taxonomy ID**: `goblin --query 1280 --prefix saureus --is_taxid`
*   **By Accession File**: `goblin --query accessions.txt --prefix my_strains` (where the file contains one NCBI Assembly accession per line).

### Filtering and Quality Control
*   **Assembly Level**: By default, GOBLIN only downloads `complete` genomes. If your target species has few completed genomes, expand the search:
    ```bash
    goblin --query "Rare Species" --prefix rare --assembly_level "complete,chromosome"
    ```
*   **Download Limits**: Use `--limit` to prevent massive downloads for well-represented species (default is 100).
    ```bash
    goblin --query "Escherichia coli" --prefix ecoli --limit 50
    ```

### Clustering Optimization (CD-HIT)
GOBLIN uses CD-HIT to reduce the protein set. You can tune the stringency of this clustering:
*   **Sequence Identity**: Adjust `--identity` (default 0.9). Lower values (e.g., 0.8) create a smaller, more diverse database.
*   **Length Difference**: Adjust `--overlap` (default 0.8) to control how much shorter a sequence can be compared to the cluster representative.
*   **Performance**: For very large datasets, use `--fast_cluster` to speed up CD-HIT, though this may slightly reduce clustering accuracy.

## Expert Tips
*   **Memory Management**: If running on a local machine with limited RAM and a large genome limit, use `--max_memory [MB]` to prevent CD-HIT from crashing the system. Setting it to `0` (default) allows unlimited usage.
*   **Parallelization**: Always specify `--cpus` to match your environment's capabilities, as CD-HIT and file processing benefit significantly from multi-threading.
*   **Output Management**: Use `--outdir` to keep your working directory clean. GOBLIN generates several metadata files (`ncbi-metadata.txt`, `genome_size.json`) alongside the final `.faa.gz` file.
*   **Prokka Integration**: The primary output `<PREFIX>.faa.gz` is designed to be passed directly to Prokka using the `--proteins` flag to improve annotation quality.
