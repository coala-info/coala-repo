[1mDisplaying help[0m
		-h --help display help
	[1mInput file options:[0m
		--csv_input [path] input file path in csv format
		--fasta_input [path] input file path in fasta format
		--fastq_input [path] input file path in fastq format
		--joining_file [path] file path of an info output from DnoisE. This option allows to use the information of previous runs of DnoisE to return different joining criteriaoutputs without running the program again
		-n --count_name [size/reads/count...] count name column 'size' by default
		-p --sep [1/2/3] separator in case of csv input file
				1='	' (tab)
				2=','
				3=';'
		-q --sequence [sequence/seq...] sequence column name, 'sequence' by default
		-s --start_sample_cols [number] first sample column (1 == 1st col) if not given, just one column with total read counts expected (see README.md)
		-z --end_sample_cols [number] last sample column (n == nst col) if not given, just one column with total read counts expected (see README.md)
	[1mOutput file options:[0m
		--csv_output [path] common path for csv format
		--fasta_output [path] common path for fasta format
		-j --joining_criteria [1/2/3/4]
				1-> will join by the lesser [abundance ratio / beta(d)] (default r_d criterion)
				2-> will join by the lesser abundance ratio (r criterion)
				3-> will join by the lesser distance (d) value (d criterion)
				4-> will provide all joining criteria in three different outputs (all)
	[1mOther options:[0m
		-a --alpha [number] alpha value, 5 by default
		-c --cores [number] number of cores, 1 by default
		-e --entropy [number,number,number] entropy values (or any user-settable measure of variability) of the different codon positions. If -y is enabled and no values are given, default entropy values are computed from the data
		-g --get_entropy get only entropy values from a dataset
		-m --modal_length [number] when running DnoisE with entropy correction, sequence length expected can be set, if not, modal_length is used and only sequences with modal_length + or - 3*n are accepted
		-r --min_abund [number] minimum abundance filtering applied at the end of analysis, 1 by default
		-u --unique_length only modal length is accepted as sequence length when running with entropy correction
		-w --within_MOTU [MOTU/motu/...] MOTU column name. This option allows to run DnoisEwithin MOTU. Is only available for --csv_input and --csv_output
		-x --first_nt_codon_position [number] as DnoisE has been developed for COI sequences amplified with Leray-XT primers, default value is 3 (i.e., the first nucleotide in the sequences is a third codon position)
		-y --entropy_correction a distance correction based on entropy is performed (see https://github.com/adriantich/DnoisE). If not enabled no correction for entropy is performed (corresponding to the standard Unoise formulation)
