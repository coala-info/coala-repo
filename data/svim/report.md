                  working_dir reads genome

positional arguments:
  working_dir           Working and output directory. Existing files in the
                        directory are overwritten. If the directory does not
                        exist, it is created.
  reads                 Read file (FASTA, FASTQ, gzipped FASTA, gzipped FASTQ
                        or file list). The read file has to have one of the
                        following supported file endings: FASTA: .fa, .fasta,
                        .FA, .fa.gz, .fa.gzip, .fasta.gz, .fasta.gzip FASTQ:
                        .fq, .fastq, .FQ, .fq.gz, .fq.gzip, .fastq.gz,
                        .fastq.gzip FILE LIST: .fa.fn, fq.fn
  genome                Reference genome file (FASTA)

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --verbose             Enable more verbose logging (default: False)

ALIGN:
  --cores CORES         CPU cores to use for the alignment (default: 1)
  --aligner {ngmlr,minimap2}
                        Tool for read alignment: ngmlr or minimap2 (default:
                        ngmlr)
  --nanopore            Use Nanopore settings for read alignment (default:
                        False)

COLLECT:
  --min_mapq MIN_MAPQ   Minimum mapping quality of reads to consider (default:
                        20). Reads with a lower mapping quality are ignored.
  --min_sv_size MIN_SV_SIZE
                        Minimum SV size to detect (default: 40). SVIM can
                        potentially detect events of any size but is limited
                        by the signal-to-noise ratio in the input alignments.
                        That means that more accurate reads and alignments
                        enable the detection of smaller events. For current
                        PacBio or Nanopore data, we would recommend a minimum
                        size of 40bp or larger.
  --max_sv_size MAX_SV_SIZE
                        Maximum SV size to detect (default: 100000). This
                        parameter is used to distinguish long deletions (and
                        inversions) from translocations which cannot be
                        distinguished from the alignment alone. Split read
                        segments mapping far apart on the reference could
                        either indicate a very long deletion (inversion) or a
                        translocation breakpoint. SVIM calls a translocation
                        breakpoint if the mapping distance is larger than this
                        parameter and a deletion (or inversion) if it is
                        smaller or equal.
  --segment_gap_tolerance SEGMENT_GAP_TOLERANCE
                        Maximum tolerated gap between adjacent alignment
                        segments (default: 10). This parameter applies to gaps
                        on the reference and the read. Example: Deletions are
                        detected from two subsequent segments of a split read
                        that are mapped far apart from each other on the
                        reference. The segment gap tolerance determines the
                        maximum tolerated length of the read gap between both
                        segments. If there is an unaligned read segment larger
                        than this value between the two segments, no deletion
                        is called.
  --segment_overlap_tolerance SEGMENT_OVERLAP_TOLERANCE
                        Maximum tolerated overlap between adjacent alignment
                        segments (default: 5). This parameter applies to
                        overlaps on the reference and the read. Example:
                        Deletions are detected from two subsequent segments of
                        a split read that are mapped far apart from each other
                        on the reference. The segment overlap tolerance
                        determines the maximum tolerated length of an overlap
                        between both segments on the read. If the overlap
                        between the two segments on the read is larger than
                        this value, no deletion is called.
  --all_bnds            Output all rearrangements additionally in BND notation
                        (default: False). By default, SV signatures from the
                        read alignments are used to detect complete SVs, such
                        as deletions, insertions and inversions. When this
                        option is enabled, all SVs are also output in breakend
                        (BND) notation as defined in the VCF specs. For
                        instance, a deletion gets two records in the VCF
                        output: 1. the normal <DEL> record and 2. a <BND>
                        record representing the novel adjacency between the
                        deletion's start and end coordinate in the sample
                        genome.

CLUSTER:
  --partition_max_distance PARTITION_MAX_DISTANCE
                        Maximum distance in bp between SVs in a partition
                        (default: 1000). Before clustering, the SV signatures
                        are divided into coarse partitions. This parameter
                        determines the maximum distance between two subsequent
                        signatures in the same partition. If the distance
                        between two subsequent signatures is larger than this
                        parameter, they are distributed into separate
                        partitions.
  --position_distance_normalizer POSITION_DISTANCE_NORMALIZER
                        Distance normalizer used for span-position distance
                        (default: 900). SVIM clusters the SV signatures using
                        an hierarchical clustering approach and a novel
                        distance metric called "span-position distance". Span-
                        position distance is the sum of two components, span
                        distance and position distance. The span distance is
                        the difference in lengths between signatures
                        normalized by the greater length and always lies in
                        the interval [0,1]. The position distance is the
                        difference in position between signatures normalized
                        by the distance normalizer (this parameter). For a
                        position difference of 1.8kb and a distance normalizer
                        of 900, the position distance will be 2. A smaller
                        distance normalizer leads to a higher position
                        distance and as a consequence increases the importance
                        of the position distance in the span-position distance
                        relative to the span distance.
  --edit_distance_normalizer EDIT_DISTANCE_NORMALIZER
                        Distance normalizer used specifically for insertions
                        (default: 1.0). SVIM clusters insertion signatures
                        using an hierarchical clustering approach and a
                        special distance metric for insertions. This distance
                        is the sum of two components, position distance and
                        edit distance between the insertion sequences. The
                        edit distance is normalized (i.e. divided) by the
                        product of the span of the longer insertion and this
                        normalizer. The position distance is the difference in
                        position between signatures normalized by the position
                        distance normalizer (another parameter). A smaller
                        edit distance normalizer leads to a larger edit
                        distance and as a consequence increases the importance
                        of the edit distance in the clustering process so that
                        only insertions with very similar sequences are
                        clustered together. A larger edit distance normalizer
                        diminishes the importance of the insertion sequences
                        in the clustering process.
  --cluster_max_distance CLUSTER_MAX_DISTANCE
                        Maximum span-position distance between SVs in a
                        cluster (default: 0.5). This is the most important
                        parameter because it determines the strictness of
                        clustering. Choosing a large value leads to fewer but
                        larger clusters with larger distances between its
                        members. Choosing a small value leads to more but
                        smaller clusters with smaller distances between its
                        members. This parameter determines the height of the
                        cut-off in the hierarchical clustering dendrogram.

COMBINE:
  --del_ins_dup_max_distance DEL_INS_DUP_MAX_DISTANCE
                        Maximum span-position distance between the origin of
                        an insertion and a deletion to be flagged as a
                        potential cut&paste insertion (default: 1.0)
  --trans_sv_max_distance TRANS_SV_MAX_DISTANCE
                        Maximum distance in bp between a translocation
                        breakpoint and an SV signature to be combined
                        (default: 500)
  --skip_consensus      Disable consensus computation for insertions (default:
                        False). This reduces the time and memory consumption
                        of SVIM and might be useful if consensus sequences are
                        not needed. With this option, insertion calls are
                        represented by symbolic alleles (<INS>) instead of
                        sequence alles in the output VCF. Consensus
                        computation requires a modern CPU with the SSE 4.1
                        instruction set. For older CPUs missing this
                        instruction set, consensus computation is
                        automatically disabled.
  --max_consensus_length MAX_CONSENSUS_LENGTH
                        Maximum size of insertion sequences for consensus
                        computation. (default: 10000) For insertions longer
                        than this threshold, no consensus is computed to save
                        memory.

GENOTYPE:
  --skip_genotyping     Disable genotyping (default: False)
  --minimum_score MINIMUM_SCORE
                        Minimum score for genotyping (default: 3). Only SV
                        candidates with a higher or equal score are genotyped.
                        Depending on the score distribution among the SV
                        candidates, decreasing this value increases the
                        runtime. We recommend to choose a value close to the
                        score threshold used for filtering the SV candidates.
  --homozygous_threshold HOMOZYGOUS_THRESHOLD
                        Minimum variant allele frequency to be called as
                        homozygous (default: 0.8). Allele frequency is
                        computed as the fraction of reads supporting the
                        variant over the total number of reads covering the
                        variant. Variants with an allele frequence greater
                        than or equal to this threshold are called as
                        homozygous alternative.
  --heterozygous_threshold HETEROZYGOUS_THRESHOLD
                        Minimum variant allele frequency to be called as
                        heterozygous (default: 0.2). Allele frequency is
                        computed as the fraction of reads supporting the
                        variant over the total number of reads covering the
                        variant. Variants with an allele frequence greater
                        than or equal to this threshold but lower than the
                        homozygous threshold are called as heterozygous
                        alternative. Variants with an allele frequence lower
                        than this threshold are called as homozygous
                        reference.
  --minimum_depth MINIMUM_DEPTH
                        Minimum total read depth for genotyping (default: 4).
                        Variants covered by a total number of reads lower than
                        this value are not assigned a genotype (./. in the
                        output VCF file).

OUTPUT:
  --sample SAMPLE       Sample ID to include in output vcf file (default:
                        Sample)
  --types TYPES         SV types to include in output VCF (default:
                        DEL,INS,INV,DUP:TANDEM,DUP:INT,BND). Give a comma-
                        separated list of SV types. The possible SV types are:
                        DEL (deletions), INS (novel insertions), INV
                        (inversions), DUP:TANDEM (tandem duplications),
                        DUP:INT (interspersed duplications), BND (breakends).
  --symbolic_alleles    Use symbolic alleles, such as <DEL> or <INV> in output
                        VCF (default: False). By default, all SV alleles are
                        represented by nucleotide sequences.
  --insertion_sequences
                        Output insertion sequences in INFO tag of VCF
                        (default: False). If enabled, the INFO/SEQS tag
                        contains a list of insertion sequences from the
                        supporting reads.
  --tandem_duplications_as_insertions
                        Represent tandem duplications as insertions in output
                        VCF (default: False). By default, tandem duplications
                        are represented by the SVTYPE=DUP:TANDEM and the
                        genomic source is given by the POS and END tags. When
                        enabling this option, duplications are instead
                        represented by the SVTYPE=INS and POS and END both
                        give the insertion point of the duplication.
  --interspersed_duplications_as_insertions
                        Represent interspersed duplications as insertions in
                        output VCF (default: False). By default, interspersed
                        duplications are represented by the SVTYPE=DUP:INT and
                        the genomic source is given by the POS and END tags.
                        When enabling this option, duplications are instead
                        represented by the SVTYPE=INS and POS and END both
                        give the insertion point of the duplication.
  --read_names          Output names of supporting reads in INFO tag of VCF
                        (default: False). If enabled, the INFO/READS tag
                        contains the list of names of the supporting reads.
  --zmws                look for information on ZMWs in PacBio read names
                        (default: False). If enabled, the INFO/ZMWS tag
                        contains the number of ZMWs that produced supporting
                        reads.

                      working_dir bam_file genome

positional arguments:
  working_dir           Working and output directory. Existing files in the
                        directory are overwritten. If the directory does not
                        exist, it is created.
  bam_file              Coordinate-sorted and indexed BAM file with aligned
                        long reads
  genome                Reference genome file that the long reads were aligned
                        to (FASTA)

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --verbose             Enable more verbose logging (default: False)

COLLECT:
  --min_mapq MIN_MAPQ   Minimum mapping quality of reads to consider (default:
                        20). Reads with a lower mapping quality are ignored.
  --min_sv_size MIN_SV_SIZE
                        Minimum SV size to detect (default: 40). SVIM can
                        potentially detect events of any size but is limited
                        by the signal-to-noise ratio in the input alignments.
                        That means that more accurate reads and alignments
                        enable the detection of smaller events. For current
                        PacBio or Nanopore data, we would recommend a minimum
                        size of 40bp or larger.
  --max_sv_size MAX_SV_SIZE
                        Maximum SV size to detect (default: 100000). This
                        parameter is used to distinguish long deletions (and
                        inversions) from translocations which cannot be
                        distinguished from the alignment alone. Split read
                        segments mapping far apart on the reference could
                        either indicate a very long deletion (inversion) or a
                        translocation breakpoint. SVIM calls a translocation
                        breakpoint if the mapping distance is larger than this
                        parameter and a deletion (or inversion) if it is
                        smaller or equal.
  --segment_gap_tolerance SEGMENT_GAP_TOLERANCE
                        Maximum tolerated gap between adjacent alignment
                        segments (default: 10). This parameter applies to gaps
                        on the reference and the read. Example: Deletions are
                        detected from two subsequent segments of a split read
                        that are mapped far apart from each other on the
                        reference. The segment gap tolerance determines the
                        maximum tolerated length of the read gap between both
                        segments. If there is an unaligned read segment larger
                        than this value between the two segments, no deletion
                        is called.
  --segment_overlap_tolerance SEGMENT_OVERLAP_TOLERANCE
                        Maximum tolerated overlap between adjacent alignment
                        segments (default: 5). This parameter applies to
                        overlaps on the reference and the read. Example:
                        Deletions are detected from two subsequent segments of
                        a split read that are mapped far apart from each other
                        on the reference. The segment overlap tolerance
                        determines the maximum tolerated length of an overlap
                        between both segments on the read. If the overlap
                        between the two segments on the read is larger than
                        this value, no deletion is called.

CLUSTER:
  --partition_max_distance PARTITION_MAX_DISTANCE
                        Maximum distance in bp between SVs in a partition
                        (default: 1000). Before clustering, the SV signatures
                        are divided into coarse partitions. This parameter
                        determines the maximum distance between two subsequent
                        signatures in the same partition. If the distance
                        between two subsequent signatures is larger than this
                        parameter, they are distributed into separate
                        partitions.
  --position_distance_normalizer POSITION_DISTANCE_NORMALIZER
                        Distance normalizer used for span-position distance
                        (default: 900). SVIM clusters the SV signatures using
                        an hierarchical clustering approach and a novel
                        distance metric called "span-position distance". Span-
                        position distance is the sum of two components, span
                        distance and position distance. The span distance is
                        the difference in lengths between signatures
                        normalized by the greater length and always lies in
                        the interval [0,1]. The position distance is the
                        difference in position between signatures normalized
                        by the distance normalizer (this parameter). For a
                        position difference of 1.8kb and a distance normalizer
                        of 900, the position distance will be 2. A smaller
                        distance normalizer leads to a higher position
                        distance and as a consequence increases the importance
                        of the position distance in the span-position distance
                        relative to the span distance.
  --edit_distance_normalizer EDIT_DISTANCE_NORMALIZER
                        Distance normalizer used specifically for insertions
                        (default: 1.0). SVIM clusters insertion signatures
                        using an hierarchical clustering approach and a
                        special distance metric for insertions. This distance
                        is the sum of two components, position distance and
                        edit distance between the insertion sequences. The
                        edit distance is normalized (i.e. divided) by the
                        product of the span of the longer insertion and this
                        normalizer. The position distance is the difference in
                        position between signatures normalized by the position
                        distance normalizer (another parameter). A smaller
                        edit distance normalizer leads to a larger edit
                        distance and as a consequence increases the importance
                        of the edit distance in the clustering process so that
                        only insertions with very similar sequences are
                        clustered together. A larger edit distance normalizer
                        diminishes the importance of the insertion sequences
                        in the clustering process.
  --cluster_max_distance CLUSTER_MAX_DISTANCE
                        Maximum span-position distance between SVs in a
                        cluster (default: 0.5). This is the most important
                        parameter because it determines the strictness of
                        clustering. Choosing a large value leads to fewer but
                        larger clusters with larger distances between its
                        members. Choosing a small value leads to more but
                        smaller clusters with smaller distances between its
                        members. This parameter determines the height of the
                        cut-off in the hierarchical clustering dendrogram.
  --all_bnds            Output all rearrangements additionally in BND notation
                        (default: False). By default, SV signatures from the
                        read alignments are used to detect complete SVs, such
                        as deletions, insertions and inversions. When this
                        option is enabled, all SVs are also output in breakend
                        (BND) notation as defined in the VCF specs. For
                        instance, a deletion gets two records in the VCF
                        output: 1. the normal <DEL> record and 2. a <BND>
                        record representing the novel adjacency between the
                        deletion's start and end coordinate in the sample
                        genome.

COMBINE:
  --del_ins_dup_max_distance DEL_INS_DUP_MAX_DISTANCE
                        Maximum span-position distance between the origin of
                        an insertion and a deletion to be flagged as a
                        potential cut&paste insertion (default: 1.0)
  --trans_sv_max_distance TRANS_SV_MAX_DISTANCE
                        Maximum distance in bp between a translocation
                        breakpoint and an SV signature to be combined
                        (default: 500)
  --skip_consensus      Disable consensus computation for insertions (default:
                        False). This reduces the time and memory consumption
                        of SVIM and might be useful if consensus sequences are
                        not needed. With this option, insertion calls are
                        represented by symbolic alleles (<INS>) instead of
                        sequence alles in the output VCF. Consensus
                        computation requires a modern CPU with the SSE 4.1
                        instruction set. For older CPUs missing this
                        instruction set, consensus computation is
                        automatically disabled.
  --max_consensus_length MAX_CONSENSUS_LENGTH
                        Maximum size of insertion sequences for consensus
                        computation. (default: 10000) For insertions longer
                        than this threshold, no consensus is computed to save
                        memory.

GENOTYPE:
  --skip_genotyping     Disable genotyping (default: False)
  --minimum_score MINIMUM_SCORE
                        Minimum score for genotyping (default: 3). Only SV
                        candidates with a higher or equal score are genotyped.
                        Depending on the score distribution among the SV
                        candidates, decreasing this value increases the
                        runtime. We recommend to choose a value close to the
                        score threshold used for filtering the SV candidates.
  --homozygous_threshold HOMOZYGOUS_THRESHOLD
                        Minimum variant allele frequency to be called as
                        homozygous (default: 0.8). Allele frequency is
                        computed as the fraction of reads supporting the
                        variant over the total number of reads covering the
                        variant. Variants with an allele frequence greater
                        than or equal to this threshold are called as
                        homozygous alternative.
  --heterozygous_threshold HETEROZYGOUS_THRESHOLD
                        Minimum variant allele frequency to be called as
                        heterozygous (default: 0.2). Allele frequency is
                        computed as the fraction of reads supporting the
                        variant over the total number of reads covering the
                        variant. Variants with an allele frequence greater
                        than or equal to this threshold but lower than the
                        homozygous threshold are called as heterozygous
                        alternative. Variants with an allele frequence lower
                        than this threshold are called as homozygous
                        reference.
  --minimum_depth MINIMUM_DEPTH
                        Minimum total read depth for genotyping (default: 4).
                        Variants covered by a total number of reads lower than
                        this value are not assigned a genotype (./. in the
                        output VCF file).

OUTPUT:
  --sample SAMPLE       Sample ID to include in output vcf file (default:
                        Sample)
  --types TYPES         SV types to include in output VCF (default:
                        DEL,INS,INV,DUP:TANDEM,DUP:INT,BND). Give a comma-
                        separated list of SV types. The possible SV types are:
                        DEL (deletions), INS (novel insertions), INV
                        (inversions), DUP:TANDEM (tandem duplications),
                        DUP:INT (interspersed duplications), BND (breakends).
  --symbolic_alleles    Use symbolic alleles, such as <DEL> or <INV> in output
                        VCF (default: False). By default, all SV alleles are
                        represented by nucleotide sequences.
  --insertion_sequences
                        Output insertion sequences in INFO tag of VCF
                        (default: False). If enabled, the INFO/SEQS tag
                        contains a list of insertion sequences from the
                        supporting reads.
  --tandem_duplications_as_insertions
                        Represent tandem duplications as insertions in output
                        VCF (default: False). By default, tandem duplications
                        are represented by the SVTYPE=DUP:TANDEM and the
                        genomic source is given by the POS and END tags. When
                        enabling this option, duplications are instead
                        represented by the SVTYPE=INS and POS and END both
                        give the insertion point of the duplication.
  --interspersed_duplications_as_insertions
                        Represent interspersed duplications as insertions in
                        output VCF (default: False). By default, interspersed
                        duplications are represented by the SVTYPE=DUP:INT and
                        the genomic source is given by the POS and END tags.
                        When enabling this option, duplications are instead
                        represented by the SVTYPE=INS and POS and END both
                        give the insertion point of the duplication.
  --read_names          Output names of supporting reads in INFO tag of VCF
                        (default: False). If enabled, the INFO/READS tag
                        contains the list of names of the supporting reads.
  --zmws                look for information on ZMWs in PacBio read names
                        (default: False). If enabled, the INFO/ZMWS tag
                        contains the number of ZMWs that produced supporting
                        reads.
