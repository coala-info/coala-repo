description: "This metatranscriptomics workflow processes taxon, gene family, and pathway abundance data using HUMAnN and MetaPhlAn tools to normalize, regroup, and rename functional features. Use this skill when you need to characterize the functional potential of a microbial community by linking specific metabolic pathways and gene families to the taxonomic groups responsible for them."

# Workflow 3: Functional Information (quick)

## Overview

This Galaxy workflow provides a streamlined approach for the functional analysis of metatranscriptomics data, specifically designed for microbiome RNA-seq studies. It processes predicted taxon relative abundances alongside gene family and pathway abundance tables to characterize the functional potential of a microbial community. The workflow is part of the [ASaiM](https://asaim.readthedocs.io/) framework and aligns with [Galaxy Training Network (GTN)](https://training.galaxyproject.org/) methodologies for metagenomics.

The pipeline utilizes the HUMAnN toolset to renormalize, regroup, and rename functional features. Key steps include converting gene family abundances into more interpretable categories (such as GO terms or Pfam domains) and unpacking pathway abundances to reveal the contributions of specific taxa. It also integrates MetaPhlAn and HUMAnN outputs to correlate gene family abundances with specific genus or species levels.

The final outputs include stratified and unstratified tables that detail the metabolic pathways and functional gene families present in the sample. These results allow researchers to identify which microbial members are responsible for specific biological functions.

## Inputs and data preparation

| Step | Label | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Predicted taxon relative abundances | data_input |  |
| 1 | Gene Family abundance | data_input |  |
| 2 | Pathway abundance | data_input |  |


Ensure your input files are in tabular format, specifically targeting the MetaPhlAn taxon abundances and HUMAnN gene family and pathway tables generated in previous steps. While these inputs are typically handled as individual datasets, ensure they are correctly labeled to match the expected stratified or unstratified structures required by the HUMAnN utility tools. For automated testing or batch execution, you can initialize a job template using `planemo workflow_job_init` to create a `job.yml` file. Refer to the `README.md` for comprehensive details on specific parameter settings and data formatting requirements.

## How to run (Planemo)

### Local Galaxy (default engine)

```bash
planemo run workflow3-functional-information-quick.ga job.yml --download_outputs --output_directory . --output_json output.json
```

Optional: `--galaxy_root /path/to/galaxy` speeds up spinning up a local Galaxy.

### Docker Galaxy

Append e.g. `--engine docker_galaxy --ignore_dependency_problems` (requires Docker).

### External Galaxy (usegalaxy.org / EU / …)

```bash
planemo run workflow3-functional-information-quick.ga job.yml --engine external_galaxy --galaxy_url SERVER_URL --galaxy_user_key YOUR_API_KEY
```

Create a reusable profile: `planemo profile_create myprofile --galaxy_url ... --galaxy_user_key ... --engine external_galaxy` then `planemo run workflow3-functional-information-quick.ga job.yml --profile myprofile`.

### Job file

- Generate a template: `planemo workflow_job_init workflow3-functional-information-quick.ga -o job.yml`
- Lint: `planemo workflow_lint workflow3-functional-information-quick.ga`

See **[Running Galaxy workflows](https://planemo.readthedocs.io/en/master/running.html)** in the Planemo documentation.

## Invocation outputs

After a successful run with `--download_outputs`, files appear under your chosen `--output_directory`. `--output_json` records CWL-style metadata for outputs (paths, checksums).

On an external Galaxy, use `planemo invocation_download INVOCATION_ID --profile ...` to fetch outputs, or track progress with `planemo workflow_track INVOCATION_ID`.

Workflow steps marked as **workflow outputs** in the editor are listed under **Workflow outputs**; exact filenames depend on tools and Galaxy configuration.

## Files

- `workflow3-functional-information-quick.ga` — Galaxy workflow export (JSON)
- `job.yml` — inputs/parameters for `planemo run` (create with `planemo workflow_job_init`)
