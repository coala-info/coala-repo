## Overview

hafeZ is a specialized bioinformatics tool designed to move beyond static prophage prediction by identifying prophages that are actively replicating or induced. It works by mapping sequencing reads to a host assembly and calculating Z-scores for read depth across the genome. Significant peaks in coverage often correspond to induced prophage elements. The tool integrates functional annotation using the PHROGS database to validate identified regions of interest (ROIs).

## Initial Database Setup

Before running analysis, you must download and format the required protein databases. 

**Important**: While the tool supports pVOGs and PHROGS, the pVOGs host is frequently down. It is recommended to use PHROGS.

```bash
hafeZ.py -G hafeZ_db/ -T phrogs
```

## Core Command Line Usage

The standard workflow requires a reference assembly (FASTA) and paired-end Illumina reads (FASTQ).

```bash
hafeZ.py -f assembly.fasta -r1 read_1.fastq.gz -r2 read_2.fastq.gz -o output_folder -D hafeZ_db/ -T phrogs
```

### Key Arguments
- `-f`: Reference genome assembly in FASTA format.
- `-r1 / -r2`: Forward and reverse paired-end reads (supports `.fastq` and `.fastq.gz`).
- `-o`: Output directory.
- `-D`: Path to the database directory created during setup.
- `-T`: Database type (`phrogs` is the current reliable standard).
- `-t`: Number of threads (default is 1; increase for faster mapping and HMM searches).
- `-Z`: Generate Z-score plots for every contig in the assembly, not just those with identified ROIs.

## Best Practices and Expert Tips

### Handling Low Coverage or No Hits
If hafeZ returns an empty `hafeZ_summary_all_rois.tsv` file, it means no regions met the statistical threshold for an active prophage. 
- Use the `-Z` flag to generate Z-score plots for all contigs. Manual inspection of these plots can reveal subtle peaks that may fall just below default detection parameters.
- Ensure your reads are paired-end Illumina; the tool is currently optimized specifically for this data type.

### Performance Optimization
The HMMER and BLAST steps can be computationally intensive. Always specify multiple threads using `-t` (e.g., `-t 8` or `-t 16`) if the hardware allows.

### Interpreting Outputs
- **hafeZ_summary_all_rois.tsv**: The primary results file. Focus on regions with high Z-scores and significant PHROG hits.
- **hafeZ_prophage_for_xxx.png**: Visual confirmation of the induction peak. A sharp, localized increase in coverage is a strong indicator of an active element.
- **hafeZ_hmm_hits.tsv**: Use this to check for essential phage genes (e.g., terminase, portal, tail fibers) in the identified region to confirm it is a true prophage and not a different mobile genetic element.

### Troubleshooting
- **MAD == 0 Error**: If you encounter issues where the Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) is zero (often due to very low or extremely uniform coverage), use the `--expect_mad_zero` flag to force graph generation.
- **Database Errors**: If the initial setup fails, verify internet connectivity to the PHROGS repository and ensure you have sufficient disk space for the HMM profiles.
