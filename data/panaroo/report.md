panaroo: an updated pipeline for pangenome investigation

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -t N_CPU, --threads N_CPU
                        number of threads to use (default=1)
  --codon-table TABLE   the codon table to use for translation (default=11)
  --quiet               suppress additional output
  --version             show program's version number and exit

Input/output:
  -i INPUT_FILES [INPUT_FILES ...], --input INPUT_FILES [INPUT_FILES ...]
                        input GFF3 files (usually output from running Prokka).
                        Can also take a file listing each gff file line by
                        line.
  -o OUTPUT_DIR, --out_dir OUTPUT_DIR
                        location of an output directory

Mode:
  --clean-mode {strict,moderate,sensitive}
                        The stringency mode at which to run panaroo. Must be
                        one of 'strict','moderate' or 'sensitive'. Each of
                        these modes can be fine tuned using the additional
                        parameters in the 'Graph correction' section.
                        
                        strict:
                        Requires fairly strong evidence (present in  at least
                        5% of genomes) to keep likely contaminant genes. Will
                        remove genes that are refound more often than they were
                        called originally.
                        
                        moderate:
                        Requires moderate evidence (present in  at least 1% of
                        genomes) to keep likely contaminant genes. Keeps genes
                        that are refound more often than they were called
                        originally.
                        
                        sensitive:
                        Does not delete any genes and only performes merge and
                        refinding operations. Useful if rare plasmids are of
                        interest as these are often hard to disguish from
                        contamination. Results will likely include  higher
                        number of spurious annotations.
  --remove-invalid-genes
                        removes annotations that do not conform to the
                        expected Prokka format such as those including
                        premature stop codons.

Matching:
  -c ID, --threshold ID
                        sequence identity threshold (default=0.98)
  -f FAMILY_THRESHOLD, --family_threshold FAMILY_THRESHOLD
                        protein family sequence identity threshold
                        (default=0.7)
  --len_dif_percent LEN_DIF_PERCENT
                        length difference cutoff (default=0.98)
  --family_len_dif_percent FAMILY_LEN_DIF_PERCENT
                        length difference cutoff at the gene family level
                        (default=0.0)
  --merge_paralogs      don't split paralogs

Refind:
  --search_radius SEARCH_RADIUS
                        the distance in nucleotides surronding the neighbour
                        of an accessory gene in which to search for it
  --refind_prop_match REFIND_PROP_MATCH
                        the proportion of an accessory gene that must be found
                        in order to consider it a match
  --refind-mode {default,strict,off}
                        The stringency mode at which to re-find genes.
                        
                        default:
                        Will re-find similar gene sequences. Allows for
                        premature stop codons and incorrect lengths to account
                        for misassemblies.
                        
                        strict:
                        Prevents fragmented, misassembled, or potential
                        pseudogene sequences from being re-found.
                        
                        off:
                        Turns off all re-finding steps.

Graph correction:
  --min_trailing_support MIN_TRAILING_SUPPORT
                        minimum cluster size to keep a gene called at the end
                        of a contig
  --trailing_recursive TRAILING_RECURSIVE
                        number of times to perform recursive trimming of low
                        support nodes near the end of contigs
  --edge_support_threshold EDGE_SUPPORT_THRESHOLD
                        minimum support required to keep an edge that has been
                        flagged as a possible mis-assembly
  --length_outlier_support_proportion LENGTH_OUTLIER_SUPPORT_PROPORTION
                        proportion of genomes supporting a gene with a length
                        more than 1.5x outside the interquatile range for
                        genes in the same cluster (default=0.01). Genes
                        failing this test will be re-annotated at the shorter
                        length
  --remove_by_consensus {True,False}
                        if a gene is called in the same region with similar
                        sequence a minority of the time, remove it. One of
                        'True' or 'False'
  --high_var_flag CYCLE_THRESHOLD_MIN
                        minimum number of nested cycles to call a highly
                        variable gene region (default = 5).
  --min_edge_support_sv MIN_EDGE_SUPPORT_SV
                        minimum edge support required to call structural
                        variants in the presence/absence sv file
  --all_seq_in_graph    Retains all DNA sequence for each gene cluster in the
                        graph output. Off by default as it uses a large amount
                        of space.
  --no_clean_edges      Turn off edge filtering in the final output graph.

Gene alignment:
  -a {core,pan}, --alignment {core,pan}
                        Output alignments of core genes or all genes. Options
                        are 'core' and 'pan'. Default: 'None'
  --aligner {prank,clustal,mafft,none}
                        Specify an aligner. Options:'prank', 'clustal', and
                        default: 'mafft'
  --codons              Generate codon alignments by aligning sequences at the
                        protein level
  --core_threshold CORE

                        Entropy (BMGE) filter. Can be between 0.0 and 1.0. By
                        default this is set using the Tukey outlier method.
