# smof

## Overview
The `smof` (Simple Manipulation Of FASTA) utility is a suite of UNIX-style tools designed specifically for biological sequence data. Unlike standard text processing tools, `smof` treats each FASTA entry (header and sequence) as a single unit. This allows for sophisticated operations like sorting by sequence length, searching for motifs across line breaks, and extracting specific genomic coordinates without breaking the FASTA format.

## Core CLI Patterns

### Sequence Exploration and Statistics
*   **Summarize a file**: Use `smof stat` to get a quick overview of sequence counts and lengths.
*   **Inspect headers**: Use `smof sniff` to extract metadata and formatting information about the file.
*   **Entry-based head/tail**: Use `smof head -n 5` to get the first 5 full entries (not just 5 lines).
*   **Diagnostic slicing**: Combine `head` with sequence limits to check start/end codons:
    `smof head -f 3 -l 3 -5 input.fasta` (Prints first and last 3 bases of the first 5 entries).

### Advanced Searching with `smof grep`
*   **Search sequences**: Use `-q` to search the sequence instead of the header.
    `smof grep -q "MKKV" proteins.faa`
*   **Extract motifs with context**: Use `-o` to output only the match, and `-A`/`-B` for flanking residues.
    `smof grep -qoA3 "SKSQ" input.fasta`
*   **Degenerate DNA search**: Use `-G` to enable IUPAC nucleotide alphabet matching.
    `smof grep -qG "RGYW" genome.fna`
*   **GFF Output**: Generate coordinates for matches directly.
    `smof grep -q --gff "ATG" genome.fna`

### Manipulation and Extraction
*   **Subsequence extraction**: Extract specific ranges (1-based).
    `smof subseq -b 10 -e 50 input.fasta`
*   **Sorting**: Sort by length (`-l`) or by a specific part of the header using regex.
    `smof sort -nx 'taxon\|(\d+)' input.fasta` (Sorts numerically by a "taxon" field in the header).
*   **Random Sampling**: Extract a representative subset for testing.
    `smof sample -n 100 input.fasta`
*   **File Splitting**: Split large files into chunks of a specific size.
    `smof split -n 10 -p chunk_ output.fasta` (Splits into 10 files).

### Cleaning and Formatting
*   **Standardize FASTA**: Use `smof clean` to remove illegal characters or fix wrapping.
*   **Translation**: Convert DNA to Protein.
    `smof translate dna.fasta > protein.faa`
*   **Format-independent Checksum**: Use `smof md5sum` to verify if two files contain the same biological data, regardless of line wrapping or case.

## Expert Tips
*   **Piping**: `smof` is designed for pipes. Always chain commands to avoid intermediate files (e.g., `smof filter ... | smof sort -l | smof head -1`).
*   **Case Sensitivity**: By default, `smof grep` is case-insensitive. Use `-I` to force case sensitivity.
*   **Regex Captures**: In `smof sort`, use parentheses in your regex to define exactly which part of the header should be used for the sort key.
*   **Memory Efficiency**: For extremely large files, `smof grep -f` with a pattern file can be slow. If searching for specific IDs, use `-w` with a regex to define the ID boundary for faster lookups.



## Subcommands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| smof | Calculates the consensus sequence from a set of sequences. |
| smof md5sum | Concatenates all headers and sequences and calculates the md5sum for the resulting string. |
| smof sample | Randomly sample entries. `sample` reads the entire file into memory, so should not be used for extremely large files. |
| smof wc | Outputs the total number of entries and the total sequence length (TAB  delimited). |
| smof_clean | Remove all space within the sequences and write them in even columns (default width of 80 characters). Case and all characters (except whitespace) are preserved by default. |
| smof_cut | Cut fields from SMOF files. |
| smof_filter | Prints every entry by default. You may add one or more criteria to filter the results (e.g. `smof filter -s 200 -l 100 -c 'GC > .5'` will print only sequences between 100 and 200 resides in length and greater than 50% GC content). |
| smof_grep | Smof grep is based on GNU grep but operates on fasta entries. It allows you to extract entries where either the header or the sequence match the search term. For sequence searches, it can produce GFF formatted output, which specifies the location of each match. |
| smof_head | `smof head` is modeled after GNU tail and follows the same basic conventions except it is entry-based rather than line-based. By default, `smof head` outputs ONE sequence (rather than the 10 line default for `head`) |
| smof_permute | Randomly order letters in each sequence. The --word-size option allows random ordering of words of the given size. The --start-offset and --end-offset options are useful if, for example, you want to rearrange the letters within a coding sequence but want to preserve the start and stop codons. |
| smof_reverse | Reverse the letters in each sequence. The complement is NOT taken unless the -c flag is set. The extended nucleotide alphabet is supported. |
| smof_sniff | Identifies the sequence type and aids in diagnostics. |
| smof_sort | Sorts the entries in a fasta file. By default, it sorts by the header strings. `sort` reads the entire file into memory, so should not be used for extremely large files. |
| smof_split | Breaks a multiple sequence fasta file into several smaller files. |
| smof_stat | The default action is to count the lengths of all sequences and output summary statistics including: 1) the number of sequences, 2) the number of characters, 3) the five-number summary of sequence lengths (minimum, 25th quantile, median, 75th quantile, and maximum), 4) the mean and standard deviation of lengths, and 5) the N50 (if you don't know what that is, you don't need to know). |
| smof_subseq | Extract subsequences from FASTA files, optionally with reverse complement, GFF input, or coloring. |
| smof_tail | `smof tail` is modeled after GNU tail and follows the same basic conventions except it is entry-based rather than line-based. `smof tail` will output ONE sequence (rather than the 10 line default for `tail`) |
| smof_translate | Translate DNA sequences to protein sequences using the standard genetic code. Ambiguous codons are translated as 'X'. Trailing characters are ignored. Gaps are removed. If --all-frames is true, the longest product is kept, with ties broken by position and then frame. Translation starts at the first nucleotide by default. |
| smof_uniq | Emulates the GNU uniq command. Two entries are considered equivalent only if their sequences AND headers are exactly equal. Newlines are ignored but all comparisons are case-sensitive. The pack/unpack option is designed to be compatible with the conventions used in the NCBI-BLAST non-redundant databases: entries with identical sequences are merged and their headers are joined with SOH (0x01) as a delimiter (by default). |
