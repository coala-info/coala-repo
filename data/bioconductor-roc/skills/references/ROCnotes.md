# Notes on ROC package

The library is a collection of R classes
and functions related to receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
curves. These functions are targeted at the use of ROC
analysis with DNA microarrays, as discussed in work of
MS Pepe, G Anderson and colleagues at U Washington Seattle
Biostatistics (unpublished report). Other open source
software for ROC analysis in the S language has been
distributed by Beth Atkinson of the Mayo Clinic.

ROC curves illustrate the performance of a classification procedure
based on dichotomous interpretation of a continuous marker. Suppose
the true state of an item is either `$+$' or`\(-\)’. The item’s marker
value is compared to a threshold, and the item is classified as
positive or negative depending on whether the marker value is greater
than or less than the threshold. For a fixed threshold \(t\), the
procedure has a sensitivity Pr(marker \(\geq t\) \(|\)true class\(=+\)) and
specificity Pr(marker \(< t\) \(|\)true class\(=-\)). The ROC curve is the
locus of values \((x, y) = (1-\mbox{spec}, \mbox{sens})\).

is an S4-style class, with slots

Let’s verify:

library(ROC)
print(getClass(“rocc”))

For creation of an ROC curve object (an instance of class
), the function is available. The name
is chosen to indicate that this is a provisional definition based on a
scalar marker.

is defined as follows:
<<>>=
print(rocdemo.sca)
@

The argument is the vector of actual states of the
objects being classified, and it must be a vector of binary
indicators. The argument is the vector of marker values.
The argument is the classification rule. This must be a
function of two arguments, and the following is an obvious approach:

<<>>=
print(dxrule.sca)

To begin working with ROC curves in R, you can proceed as follows.

<<>>=
set.seed(123)
state <- c(0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1)
markers <- c(1,2,1,1,2,3,3,4,2,1,1,3,2,3,2,4,5,2,3,4)+runif(20,-1,1)
roc1 <- rocdemo.sca( truth=state, data=markers, rule=dxrule.sca )
@

The area under the ROC curve is well known to be equivalent to the
numerator of the Mann-Whitney U statistic comparing the marker
distributions among positive and negative items. Even if the overall
area is not very large, the existence of threshold values yielding
sensitivities markedly greater than the false positive rate can be of
interest. The sensitivity at a false positive rate \(t\) is denoted
ROC(\(t\)); the AUC = \(\int\_0^1 ROC(u)du\). Finally, the partial AUC to
a false positive rate \(s\) is denoted pAUC(\(s\)) = \(\int\_0^s ROC(u)du\).

<<>>=
auc <- AUC(roc1); print(auc)
paucp4 <- pAUC(roc1,.4); print(paucp4)
rocp3 <- ROC(roc1,.3); print(rocp3)

@
Note that the definition of the AUC uses a naive trapezoidal rule.
This is faster than . However, functions
AUCi and pAUCi that use the more accurate integrate() function
are available.

<<>>=
print(trapezint)

See the Biobase package for a discussion of the
class, which represents a collection of
microarrays. Given a dichotomous element from the
slot, an AnnotatedDataFrame, of an
object, an ROC curve may be defined using
the expression levels of any gene as the vector of marker values.

We confine activities to the first 50 genes in
sample.ExpressionSet so that this vignette is computable in
reasonable CPU time.

<<>>=
library(Biobase)
data(sample.ExpressionSet)
myauc <- function(x) {
dx <- as.numeric(sex) - 1 # phenoData is installed
AUC( rocdemo.sca( truth=dx, data=x, rule=dxrule.sca ) )
}
mypauc1 <- function(x) {
dx <- as.numeric(sex) - 1
pAUC( rocdemo.sca( truth=dx, data=x, rule=dxrule.sca ), .1 )
}

allAUC <- esApply( sample.ExpressionSet[1:50,], 1, myauc )

allpAUC1 <- esApply( sample.ExpressionSet[1:50,], 1, mypauc1 )

print(featureNames(sample.ExpressionSet[1:50,])[order(allAUC, decreasing = TRUE)[1]])

print(featureNames(sample.ExpressionSet[1:50,])[order(allpAUC1, decreasing = TRUE)[1]])

Pepe et al indicate that rankings based on ROC functionals
are of interest, and that uncertainty in rankings can
be exposed by resampling tissues. Working with
s, this is easy to carry out. (We use
a very small number of resamplings (5) to get through this
in a reasonable execution time.)

<<>>=
nResamp <- 5
nTiss <- ncol(exprs(sample.ExpressionSet))
nGenes <- nrow(exprs(sample.ExpressionSet[1:50,]))
out <- matrix(NA,nr=nGenes, nc=nResamp)
set.seed(123)
for (i in 1:nResamp)
{
TissInds <- sample(1:nTiss, size=nTiss, replace=TRUE)
out[,i] <- esApply( sample.ExpressionSet[1:50,TissInds], 1, myauc )
}
rout <- apply(out,2,rank)

@
Each row of the matrix is a sample from the
bootstrap distribution of AUC ranks for the corresponding gene.
