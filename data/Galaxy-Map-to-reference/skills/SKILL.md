description: This workflow processes paired-end Illumina amplicon pool sequencing data by performing quality control, merging reads with Pear, and mapping them to a reference sequence using Bowtie2 to generate a consensus sequence and coverage statistics. Use this skill when you need to reconstruct specific genetic sequences from amplicon libraries, evaluate mapping depth across a reference, or isolate unmapped reads for further assembly and analysis.

# map-to-reference

## Overview

This Galaxy workflow is designed to reconstruct consensus sequences from amplicon pool sequencing data using a reference-based mapping approach. It processes paired-end Illumina reads in FASTQ format, utilizing [Pear](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/pear/iuc_pear/0.9.6.4) for merging and [FastQC](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/devteam/fastqc/fastqc/0.74+galaxy1) for quality control at multiple stages of the pipeline.

The core of the workflow involves filtering reads by size and mapping them against a provided reference sequence using [Bowtie2](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/devteam/bowtie2/bowtie2/2.5.4+galaxy0). It incorporates primer trimming via [Cutadapt](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/lparsons/cutadapt/cutadapt/5.1+galaxy0) and sequence assembly with [MEGAHIT](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/megahit/megahit/1.2.9+galaxy2) to generate a final consensus.

The workflow outputs comprehensive results, including a visualized consensus sequence via [JBrowse2](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/fubar/jbrowse2/jbrowse2/3.6.5+galaxy0) and a detailed metadata file. This metadata includes the consensus length, the number of mapped reads, and coverage statistics (average, minimum, and maximum depth) calculated using [Samtools](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/samtools_depth/samtools_depth/1.21+galaxy0) and [Datamash](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/datamash_ops/datamash_ops/1.9+galaxy0).

This tool is released under the MIT license and is tagged for `map_to_reference`, `pool_amplicon`, and `illumina` applications.

## Inputs and data preparation

| Step | Label | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | FASTQ - Forward | data_input | Enter the bank containing the forward reads. |
| 1 | FASTQ - Reverse | data_input | Enter the bank containing the reverse reads. |
| 2 | Filter FASTQ - Minimum size | parameter_input | Minimum reads filtering size.  Leave 0 if no filtering. |
| 3 | Filter FASTQ - Maximum size | parameter_input | Maximum reads filtering size.  Leave 0 if no filtering. |
| 4 | Reference sequence | data_input | Enter your reference sequence. |
| 5 | Forward primer | parameter_input | Enter your forward primer in capital letters. |
| 6 | Reverse primer | parameter_input | Enter your reverse primer in capital letters. |


Ensure your input reads are in FASTQ format and your reference sequence is in FASTA format before starting the analysis. While the workflow accepts individual datasets for forward and reverse reads, you can use a paired-end collection to streamline data handling during the initial QC and merging steps. Verify that your primer sequences and size filter parameters match your specific amplicon library preparation to ensure accurate mapping and consensus generation. For automated execution and parameter management, you can initialize a job configuration using `planemo workflow_job_init`. Refer to the README.md for comprehensive details on metadata outputs and unmapped read retrieval.

## How to run (Planemo)

### Local Galaxy (default engine)

```bash
planemo run Galaxy-Workflow-Map-to-reference.ga job.yml --download_outputs --output_directory . --output_json output.json
```

Optional: `--galaxy_root /path/to/galaxy` speeds up spinning up a local Galaxy.

### Docker Galaxy

Append e.g. `--engine docker_galaxy --ignore_dependency_problems` (requires Docker).

### External Galaxy (usegalaxy.org / EU / …)

```bash
planemo run Galaxy-Workflow-Map-to-reference.ga job.yml --engine external_galaxy --galaxy_url SERVER_URL --galaxy_user_key YOUR_API_KEY
```

Create a reusable profile: `planemo profile_create myprofile --galaxy_url ... --galaxy_user_key ... --engine external_galaxy` then `planemo run Galaxy-Workflow-Map-to-reference.ga job.yml --profile myprofile`.

### Job file

- Generate a template: `planemo workflow_job_init Galaxy-Workflow-Map-to-reference.ga -o job.yml`
- Lint: `planemo workflow_lint Galaxy-Workflow-Map-to-reference.ga`

See **[Running Galaxy workflows](https://planemo.readthedocs.io/en/master/running.html)** in the Planemo documentation.

## Invocation outputs

After a successful run with `--download_outputs`, files appear under your chosen `--output_directory`. `--output_json` records CWL-style metadata for outputs (paths, checksums).

On an external Galaxy, use `planemo invocation_download INVOCATION_ID --profile ...` to fetch outputs, or track progress with `planemo workflow_track INVOCATION_ID`.

Workflow steps marked as **workflow outputs** in the editor are listed under **Workflow outputs**; exact filenames depend on tools and Galaxy configuration.

## Files

- `Galaxy-Workflow-Map-to-reference.ga` — Galaxy workflow export (JSON)
- `job.yml` — inputs/parameters for `planemo run` (create with `planemo workflow_job_init`)
