# bioconductor-scanvis

name: bioconductor-scanvis
description: Scoring, annotating, and visualizing splice junctions (SJs) from RNA-seq data. Use when Claude needs to: (1) Annotate splice junctions with gene names, types (exon-skip, alt5p, alt3p, etc.), and frame-shifts, (2) Calculate Relative Read Support (RRS) scores to identify aberrant splicing, (3) Map genomic variants to specific junctions, or (4) Generate annotated sashimi plots for specific genes or genomic regions.

# bioconductor-scanvis

## Overview

SCANVIS (SCoring, ANnotating and VISualizing) is a Bioconductor package designed to process splice junction (SJ) data. It categorizes junctions into types such as exon-skip, alternative 5'/3' splice sites, IsoSwitch, and Novel Exons (NE). It calculates a Relative Read Support (RRS) score, which compares query junction support against the median support of annotated junctions in the same genomic interval, providing a robust metric for identifying rare or aberrant splicing events.

## Core Workflow

### 1. Prepare Annotation Data
SCANVIS requires a specific annotation object. You can generate this from a GTF file.

```r
library(SCANVIS)
# Generate annotation from a GTF URL or local path
gen19 <- SCANVISannotation(gtf_url) 

# The resulting object contains:
# gen19$GENES, gen19$GENES.merged, gen19$EXONS, gen19$INTRONS
```

### 2. SCore and ANnotate (SCAN)
Process a sample's splice junctions. The input `sj` should be a data frame or matrix with columns: `chr`, `start`, `end`, and `uniq.reads`.

```r
# Basic scanning
# Rcut: minimum read support for unannotated junctions
# bam/samtools: optional, used for Relative Read-Coverage (RRC) of Novel Exons
sample_scn <- SCANVISscan(sj = my_sj_data, gen = gen19, Rcut = 5)

# Result includes: JuncType, RRS, gene_name, and FrameStatus
head(sample_scn)
```

### 3. Map Variants (Optional)
If variant data (VCF-like format) is available, map them to the scanned junctions.

```r
# p: padding in base pairs (default 0)
sample_scnv <- SCANVISlinkvar(sample_scn, my_vcf_data, gen19, p = 100)
```

### 4. Visualization
Generate sashimi plots for a Region of Interest (ROI). The ROI can be a gene name or a vector of coordinates `c(chr, start, end)`.

```r
# Visualize a single gene
SCANVISvisual(roi = "PPA2", gen = gen19, sj = sample_scnv, TITLE = "Sample A")

# Merge multiple samples into one plot for comparison
sample_list <- list(Sample1 = scn1, Sample2 = scn2)
SCANVISvisual(roi = "PPA2", gen = gen19, sj = sample_list, TITLE = "Merged Cohort")
```

## Key Parameters and Tips

- **Junction Types**: SCANVIS identifies `exon-skip`, `alt5p`, `alt3p`, `IsoSwitch` (straddling mutually exclusive isoforms), `Unknown` (intronic), and `Novel Exon`.
- **RRS Score**: A ratio of query reads to (query + median local annotated reads). Low RRS often indicates rare/unannotated events.
- **Frame Status**: The package automatically determines if a junction induces a frame-shift (`InFrame` vs `OUTframe`) based on the provided annotation.
- **BAM Integration**: While optional, providing a `bam` path and `samtools` executable path to `SCANVISscan` allows for the calculation of Relative Read-Coverage (RRC) for Novel Exons, though this increases compute time.
- **Sashimi Customization**:
    - `full.annot = TRUE`: Shows all isoforms in the annotation.
    - `USJ = 'RRS'`: Colors unannotated junctions by their RRS score.
    - `SJ.special`: Pass a matrix of specific junctions to highlight them in the plot.
