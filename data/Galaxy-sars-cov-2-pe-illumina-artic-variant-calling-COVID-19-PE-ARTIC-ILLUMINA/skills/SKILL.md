description: This workflow processes Illumina paired-end SARS-CoV-2 ARTIC sequencing data using BWA-MEM for mapping, ivar for primer trimming and amplicon bias correction, and lofreq for high-sensitivity variant calling. Use this skill when you need to identify and annotate genomic variants in COVID-19 samples while mitigating the effects of primer-binding site mutations on allele frequency estimates.

# covid-19-variation-analysis-on-artic-pe-data

## Overview

This Galaxy workflow is designed for the variation analysis of SARS-CoV-2 paired-end (PE) data generated using the ARTIC sequencing protocol. It extends standard RNASeq variant calling pipelines by incorporating specialized logic to handle amplicon-based sequencing artifacts. The process maps reads to the NC_045512.2 reference genome and identifies single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and indels with high sensitivity.

The pipeline begins with quality control and adapter trimming via [fastp](https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp), followed by alignment using [BWA-MEM](https://github.com/lh3/bwa). A critical component of this workflow is the use of the [ivar](https://andersen-lab.github.io/ivar/html/manualpage.html) package to trim ARTIC primer sequences from the reads. Furthermore, the workflow identifies amplicons compromised by mutations in primer-binding sites and excludes "tainted" reads to ensure accurate allele-frequency calculations.

Variant calling is executed through the [LoFreq](https://csb5.github.io/lofreq/) suite, which includes Viterbi realignment and indel quality insertion to improve call accuracy. The resulting variants are filtered and annotated for functional impact using [SnpEff](https://pcingola.github.io/SnpEff/). Comprehensive quality metrics and mapping statistics are aggregated into [MultiQC](https://multiqc.info/) reports for final inspection.

For detailed information on input requirements, parameter settings, and data preparation, please refer to the [README.md](README.md) in the Files section. This workflow is released under the MIT license and is maintained as part of the [covid19.galaxyproject.org](https://covid19.galaxyproject.org) initiative.

## Inputs and data preparation

| Step | Label | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Paired Collection | data_collection_input | Illumina reads from ARTIC assay with fastqsanger encoding |
| 1 | NC_045512.2 FASTA sequence of SARS-CoV-2 | data_input | Fasta sequence for Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 isolate Wuhan-Hu-1, complete genome |
| 2 | ARTIC primer BED | data_input | BED file containing ARTIC primer positions. Can be retrieved from https://usegalaxy.eu/u/wolfgang-maier/h/covid-19-resources |
| 3 | ARTIC primers to amplicon assignments | data_input | Used by ivar trim and ivar removereads for assigning primers to amplicons. Should have one line of tab-separated primer names per amplicon. Can be retrieved from https://usegalaxy.eu/u/wolfgang-maier/h/covid-19-resources |
| 4 | Read removal minimum AF | parameter_input | Minimum allele-frequency required for a candidate primer binding site mutation to trigger amplicon removal. Variants with AF values below this threshold are treated as possible false-positives, which are not worth the coverage loss associated with amplicon removal. |
| 5 | Read removal maximum AF | parameter_input | Maximum allele-frequency allowed for a primer binding site mutation to trigger amplicon removal. Variants with AF values above this threshold are treated as fixed variants, which won't generate amplicon bias. |
| 6 | Minimum DP required after amplicon bias correction | parameter_input | At any given variant site use the amplicon bias-corrected recall only if the depth of coverage of the site retains at least this value after amplicon removal. |
| 7 | Minimum DP_ALT required after amplicon bias correction | parameter_input | At any given variant site use the amplicon bias-corrected recall only if the depth of variant-supporting reads at the site retains at least this value after amplicon removal. |


To run this workflow, organize your paired-end Illumina reads into a Paired Collection and ensure you have the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome in FASTA format alongside the specific ARTIC primer BED and amplicon assignment files. Using a collection is essential for the workflow to correctly process multiple samples through the `ivar` trimming and amplicon bias correction steps. For a comprehensive guide on file formatting and parameter settings, refer to the `README.md`. You can automate the setup of these inputs and parameters by using `planemo workflow_job_init` to generate a `job.yml` file.

## How to run (Planemo)

### Local Galaxy (default engine)

```bash
planemo run pe-artic-variation.ga job.yml --download_outputs --output_directory . --output_json output.json
```

Optional: `--galaxy_root /path/to/galaxy` speeds up spinning up a local Galaxy.

### Docker Galaxy

Append e.g. `--engine docker_galaxy --ignore_dependency_problems` (requires Docker).

### External Galaxy (usegalaxy.org / EU / …)

```bash
planemo run pe-artic-variation.ga job.yml --engine external_galaxy --galaxy_url SERVER_URL --galaxy_user_key YOUR_API_KEY
```

Create a reusable profile: `planemo profile_create myprofile --galaxy_url ... --galaxy_user_key ... --engine external_galaxy` then `planemo run pe-artic-variation.ga job.yml --profile myprofile`.

### Job file

- Generate a template: `planemo workflow_job_init pe-artic-variation.ga -o job.yml`
- Lint: `planemo workflow_lint pe-artic-variation.ga`

See **[Running Galaxy workflows](https://planemo.readthedocs.io/en/master/running.html)** in the Planemo documentation.

## Invocation outputs

After a successful run with `--download_outputs`, files appear under your chosen `--output_directory`. `--output_json` records CWL-style metadata for outputs (paths, checksums).

On an external Galaxy, use `planemo invocation_download INVOCATION_ID --profile ...` to fetch outputs, or track progress with `planemo workflow_track INVOCATION_ID`.

Workflow steps marked as **workflow outputs** in the editor are listed under **Workflow outputs**; exact filenames depend on tools and Galaxy configuration.
