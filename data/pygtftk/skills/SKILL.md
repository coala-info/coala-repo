# pygtftk

## Overview

The Python GTF toolkit (`pygtftk`) is a high-performance suite designed specifically for the manipulation and analysis of GTF/GFF2.0 files. While it provides a Python API, its primary interface is the `gtftk` command-line program, which offers a wide array of atomic tools for genomic data science. It is particularly robust for handling large-scale annotations like those from Ensembl. A standout feature is the OLOGRAM (OverLap Of Genomic Regions Analysis using Monte Carlo) command, which allows for sophisticated enrichment analysis of genomic regions and their n-wise combinations.

## Core CLI Usage and Patterns

The primary entry point is the `gtftk` executable. Most operations follow a subcommand structure.

### Getting Started and Examples
To explore the tool's capabilities or retrieve test data:
- List all subcommands: `gtftk -h`
- Retrieve example datasets: `gtftk get_example -d simple -f "*"`
- List functional tests for plugins: `gtftk -p`

### Common Workflow Operations
- **Feature Extraction**: Use specific subcommands to isolate exons, promoters, terminators, or introns from a master GTF file.
- **Sequence Retrieval**: Use `gtftk get_tx_seq` to extract transcript sequences, ensuring your FASTA chromosome names match your GTF.
- **Filtering**: Filter GTF entries based on keys/values (e.g., `gene_biotype`) or numeric thresholds.

### OLOGRAM (Overlap Analysis)
OLOGRAM is used to compute overlap statistics between user-supplied BED files and GTF-derived annotations.
- **Basic Overlap**: Compare peaks/regions against gene-centric features.
- **N-wise Combinations**: Analyze groups of regions (e.g., A+B+C) to find correlation groups.
- **Custom Keys**: You can add numeric values to genes and discretize them to create custom classes for enrichment testing.

## Expert Tips and Best Practices

- **Format Constraints**: `pygtftk` specifically supports GTF and GFF2.0. It does **not** support GFF3. If you have GFF3 files, convert them to GTF before using this toolkit.
- **Memory Management**: Processing human-scale Ensembl annotations (e.g., Release 91+) is memory-intensive. A minimum of 16GB of RAM is recommended, especially when piping multiple `gtftk` commands together.
- **Piping**: `gtftk` is designed to work with UNIX pipes. You can chain multiple filtering and transformation commands to avoid creating massive intermediate files.
- **Plugin Architecture**: The toolkit is extensible. If a specific atomic operation is missing, it can be added via the plugin system located in `~/.gtftk`.
- **Chromosome Naming**: When using sequence-based tools like `get_tx_seq`, ensure that the chromosome naming convention (e.g., "chr1" vs "1") is consistent between your GTF and your reference FASTA to avoid "No genes found" errors.
