# Displaying multiple trees[](#displaying-multiple-trees "Link to this heading")

Auspice has the ability to display two trees side-by-side, and to draw lines between tips with the same name (aka tanglegrams). This is useful to compare the shape of different trees, especially when they are from the same organism – for instance comparing phylogenies constructed from different segments of the same influenza virus can tell you a lot about the different histories of the segments which have the capacity to reassort (see image below).

## How to load multiple trees[](#how-to-load-multiple-trees "Link to this heading")

You can compare any two datasets which you have available – for instance if you had “flu/seasonal/h3n2/ha/2y” and “flu/seasonal/h3n2/na/2y” then loading the URL “flu/seasonal/h3n2/ha/2y:flu/seasonal/h3n2/na/2y” would load them both. A toggle is made available in the sidebar to turn off the lines drawn between tips.

![two-trees](../_images/tangle.png) *Comparing epitope mutations between HA and NA (worldwide influena H3N2).* *Notice how the segments can differ drastically in how many epitope mutations they acquire!* *While the crossing of the lines between the tips doesn’t always prove reassortment, it’s usually a good indication that reassortment is present.*

## Showing potential datasets in the sidebar[](#showing-potential-datasets-in-the-sidebar "Link to this heading")

Depending on the way you’ve labelled your datasets, potential second trees are available in a sidebar dropdown. These are defined by the [getAvailable API request](../server/api.html#server-api-charon-getavailable). Currently, the logic in `auspice view` is to match all datasets which:

* contain the same first “part” of the URL – interpreted here to represent the same pathogen.
* have the same number of “parts” in the URL (parts are delimited by a `_` in the filename or a `/` in the URL).
* differ from the currently selected dataset by only 1 part.
