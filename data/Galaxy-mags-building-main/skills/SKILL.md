description: "This workflow generates dereplicated metagenome-assembled genomes from paired short reads using assemblers like metaSPAdes or MEGAHIT, multiple binners refined by Binette, and downstream tools for taxonomic assignment and functional annotation. Use this skill when you need to reconstruct high-quality microbial genomes from environmental samples to characterize taxonomic diversity, estimate relative abundances, and identify functional potential across multiple metagenomic datasets."

# Metagenome-Assembled Genomes (MAGs) generation

## Overview

This workflow, tagged as **FAIRyMAGs**, automates the generation of Metagenome-Assembled Genomes (MAGs) from paired-end short reads. It supports flexible assembly strategies using either **metaSPADES** or **MEGAHIT**, allowing users to process individual samples, pooled datasets, or grouped co-assemblies. The pipeline is designed to handle quality-filtered reads and produce a non-redundant set of dereplicated MAGs for downstream analysis.

To maximize the quality of recovered genomes, the workflow employs a multi-tool binning approach using **MetaBAT2**, **MaxBin2**, **SemiBin**, and **CONCOCT**. These preliminary bins are then refined using [Binette](https://github.com/physiopy/binette), which optimizes contig selection to produce higher-quality bins than individual binners alone. 

Following refinement, the MAGs are dereplicated across all samples using [dRep](https://github.com/Aritra96/dRep) based on **CheckM2** quality metrics. The final high-quality genomes undergo taxonomic assignment with **GTDB-Tk**, functional annotation via **Bakta**, and abundance estimation per sample using **CoverM**. All results, including quality control metrics from **QUAST** and **CheckM**, are consolidated into a single **MultiQC** report for easy interpretation.

## Inputs and data preparation

| Step | Label | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Trimmed reads | data_collection_input | These should be the reads from the samples to estimate MAGs abundance in the original samples. |
| 1 | Trimmed reads from grouped samples | data_collection_input | Samples grouped for co-assembly. For individual assembly use same reads as `Trimmed reads input`. The tool fastq_groupmerge can be used to perform the grouping. |
| 2 | Choose Assembler | parameter_input | The workflow can use MEGAHIT and metaSPAdes as assembler |
| 3 | Minimum length of contigs to output | parameter_input | Minimum length of contigs to output (only for MEGAHIT). |
| 4 | Custom Assemblies | data_collection_input | This workflow allows using a custom assembly as input. If provided, select `custom assembly` as Assembler. Provide one assembly for each group of trimmed input reads. |
| 5 | Environment for the built-in model (SemiBin) | parameter_input | Environment for the built-in model (SemiBin), options are: human_gut, dog_gut, ocean, soil, cat_gut, human_oral, mouse_gut, pig_gut, built_environment, wastewater, chicken_caecum, global |
| 6 | Minimum MAG completeness percentage | parameter_input | Minimum MAG completeness percentage for bin refinement (binette) and dereplication (drep) |
| 7 | Contamination weight (Binette) | parameter_input | This weight is used for the scoring the bins. A low weight favor complete bins over low contaminated bins (--contamination_weight) |
| 8 | Read length (CONCOCT) | parameter_input | CONCOCT requires the read length for coverage. Best use fastQC to estimate the mean value. |
| 9 | CheckM2 Database | parameter_input | CheckM2 Reference Database used for quality assessment for Binette, dRep, and  quality assessment of the final bins |
| 10 | Minimum MAG length | parameter_input | Minimum MAG length for dereplication |
| 11 | ANI threshold for dereplication | parameter_input | ANI threshold to form secondary clusters of dereplication. An ANI value of ≥95-96% indicates genomes belong to the same species, an ANI of ≥98-99% suggests they are the same strain, and an ANI of ≤90-95% typically points to genomes from different genera. |
| 12 | Maximum MAG contamination percentage | parameter_input | Maximum MAG contamination percentage for dereplication |
| 13 | Run GTDB-Tk on MAGs | parameter_input | GTDB-Tk can take a long time and requires a lot of memory, run only if taxonomic placement is required. |
| 14 | GTDB-tk Database | parameter_input | GTDB-tk Database used for Bin Taxonomy  Classification |
| 15 | Bakta Database | parameter_input | Bakta Database - ideally use the newest installed on the server |
| 16 | AMRFinderPlus Database for Bakta | parameter_input | AMRFinderPlus Database for Bakta - ideally use the newest installed in the server |


This workflow requires quality-filtered, host-removed paired-end short reads provided as data collections. You must provide both individual sample collections and grouped/merged collections (using tools like `fastq_groupmerge`) to define your assembly strategy, whether individual, pooled, or hybrid. Ensure all fastq files are correctly typed and that you have selected the appropriate CheckM2, GTDB-Tk, and Bakta databases as workflow parameters. For a comprehensive guide on merging strategies and managing computational demands for large datasets, refer to the README.md. You can use `planemo workflow_job_init` to generate a `job.yml` for configuring these inputs and parameters.

## How to run (Planemo)

### Local Galaxy (default engine)

```bash
planemo run MAGs-generation.ga job.yml --download_outputs --output_directory . --output_json output.json
```

Optional: `--galaxy_root /path/to/galaxy` speeds up spinning up a local Galaxy.

### Docker Galaxy

Append e.g. `--engine docker_galaxy --ignore_dependency_problems` (requires Docker).

### External Galaxy (usegalaxy.org / EU / …)

```bash
planemo run MAGs-generation.ga job.yml --engine external_galaxy --galaxy_url SERVER_URL --galaxy_user_key YOUR_API_KEY
```

Create a reusable profile: `planemo profile_create myprofile --galaxy_url ... --galaxy_user_key ... --engine external_galaxy` then `planemo run MAGs-generation.ga job.yml --profile myprofile`.

### Job file

- Generate a template: `planemo workflow_job_init MAGs-generation.ga -o job.yml`
- Lint: `planemo workflow_lint MAGs-generation.ga`

See **[Running Galaxy workflows](https://planemo.readthedocs.io/en/master/running.html)** in the Planemo documentation.

## Invocation outputs

After a successful run with `--download_outputs`, files appear under your chosen `--output_directory`. `--output_json` records CWL-style metadata for outputs (paths, checksums).

On an external Galaxy, use `planemo invocation_download INVOCATION_ID --profile ...` to fetch outputs, or track progress with `planemo workflow_track INVOCATION_ID`.

Workflow steps marked as **workflow outputs** in the editor are listed under **Workflow outputs**; exact filenames depend on tools and Galaxy configuration.
