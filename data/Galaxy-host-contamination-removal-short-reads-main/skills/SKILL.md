description: "This microbiome workflow processes paired-end Illumina short-reads by mapping them against a reference genome using Bowtie2 and aggregating mapping statistics with MultiQC to isolate non-host sequences. Use this skill when you need to filter out human or host DNA contamination from metagenomic samples to prevent biased results and reduce computational overhead in downstream microbiome analysis."

# Host or Contamination Removal on Short-Reads

## Overview

This workflow is designed to filter out host or contaminant sequences from microbiome DNA or RNA samples. By removing non-target sequences from paired-end Illumina datasets, the pipeline speeds up downstream analysis and prevents host genetic material from compromising microbiome results.

The process utilizes [Bowtie2](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/devteam/bowtie2/bowtie2/2.5.4+galaxy0) to map input reads against a user-defined reference genome, such as human. It specifically retains only the reads that do not align with the reference, outputting them as filtered `fastqsanger` or `fastqsanger.gz` files.

In addition to the filtered reads, the workflow generates mapping statistics for each sample. These reports are aggregated using [MultiQC](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/multiqc/multiqc/1.33+galaxy0) to provide a comprehensive HTML summary of the contamination removal process. This workflow is specifically optimized for short-read data; for long-read sequencing, alternative pipelines should be used.

## Inputs and data preparation

| Step | Label | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Short-reads | data_collection_input | Short-reads as a paired-end collection of fastqsanger(.gz) files |
| 1 | Host/Contaminant Reference Genome | parameter_input | Reads not mapping to this reference genome will be kept. |


Ensure your input short-reads are organized as a paired-end dataset collection in `fastqsanger` or `fastqsanger.gz` format to maintain sample associations throughout the Bowtie2 mapping process. You must provide a compatible host or contaminant reference genome, typically in FASTA format, to serve as the alignment target for filtering. For automated testing or batch execution, consider using `planemo workflow_job_init` to generate a `job.yml` file. Refer to the `README.md` for comprehensive details on parameter settings and expected output formats.

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2 | Bowtie2 | toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/devteam/bowtie2/bowtie2/2.5.4+galaxy0 | Map the reads against a reference genome and output the ones not mapping the reference genome |

## How to run (Planemo)

### Local Galaxy (default engine)

```bash
planemo run host-or-contamination-removal-on-short-reads.ga job.yml --download_outputs --output_directory . --output_json output.json
```

Optional: `--galaxy_root /path/to/galaxy` speeds up spinning up a local Galaxy.

### Docker Galaxy

Append e.g. `--engine docker_galaxy --ignore_dependency_problems` (requires Docker).

### External Galaxy (usegalaxy.org / EU / …)

```bash
planemo run host-or-contamination-removal-on-short-reads.ga job.yml --engine external_galaxy --galaxy_url SERVER_URL --galaxy_user_key YOUR_API_KEY
```

Create a reusable profile: `planemo profile_create myprofile --galaxy_url ... --galaxy_user_key ... --engine external_galaxy` then `planemo run host-or-contamination-removal-on-short-reads.ga job.yml --profile myprofile`.

### Job file

- Generate a template: `planemo workflow_job_init host-or-contamination-removal-on-short-reads.ga -o job.yml`
- Lint: `planemo workflow_lint host-or-contamination-removal-on-short-reads.ga`

See **[Running Galaxy workflows](https://planemo.readthedocs.io/en/master/running.html)** in the Planemo documentation.

## Invocation outputs

After a successful run with `--download_outputs`, files appear under your chosen `--output_directory`. `--output_json` records CWL-style metadata for outputs (paths, checksums).

On an external Galaxy, use `planemo invocation_download INVOCATION_ID --profile ...` to fetch outputs, or track progress with `planemo workflow_track INVOCATION_ID`.

Workflow steps marked as **workflow outputs** in the editor are listed under **Workflow outputs**; exact filenames depend on tools and Galaxy configuration.
