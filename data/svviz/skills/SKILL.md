description: svviz visualizes structural variants by re-aligning sequencing reads to both reference and alternative alleles to confirm their validity. Use when user asks to manually inspect individual structural variants, process variants from a VCF file for batch visualization, compare read support across multiple samples, or export high-quality variant visualizations for publication.

# svviz

## Overview

svviz is a specialized tool designed to help researchers confirm structural variants by visualizing how high-throughput sequencing reads align to both the reference genome and a proposed variant sequence. Unlike standard genome browsers that show reads in a single genomic context, svviz re-aligns reads to both the "ref" and "alt" alleles, making it much easier to distinguish true variants from alignment artifacts or mapping errors.

Use this skill when you need to:
- Manually inspect individual SVs to confirm their validity.
- Process a list of variants from a VCF file to generate summary visualizations.
- Compare read support across multiple samples for the same variant.
- Export high-quality visualizations of structural variants for publication.

## Installation and Setup

The tool is primarily available via Bioconda or pip:

```bash
# Using Conda (Recommended)
conda install bioconda::svviz

# Using pip
pip install svviz
```

To verify the installation and see the tool in action, run the built-in demo:
```bash
svviz demo
```

## Common CLI Patterns

### Visualizing a Single Variant
To inspect a specific variant, provide the reference genome, the variant description, and one or more BAM files.

```bash
svviz <ref.fasta> <variant_description> <sample1.bam> [sample2.bam ...]
```
*Note: The variant description format depends on the SV type (e.g., "chr1 1000000 deletion 500").*

### Batch Processing with VCF
For large-scale validation, use the batch mode to process all variants in a VCF file. This typically generates a summary report or a series of static images.

```bash
svviz --batch <variants.vcf> <ref.fasta> <sample.bam>
```

### Interactive Web View
By default, svviz often launches an interactive web-based browser. You can specify the port if needed:
```bash
svviz <ref.fasta> <variant> <sample.bam> --port 8080
```

## Expert Tips and Best Practices

- **Reference Requirement**: Always ensure the reference FASTA file is indexed and matches the coordinates used in your BAM and VCF files. svviz will fail if the reference is not provided.
- **Performance Optimization**: Use the `--fast` flag when working with Illumina data. This increases processing speed (approx. 2x) by using a less exhaustive alignment algorithm for secondary hits, which is usually sufficient for short-read data.
- **Ambiguous Reads**: svviz categorizes reads as "ref-supporting," "alt-supporting," or "ambiguous." Pay close attention to the ambiguous category; if a large portion of reads are ambiguous, the variant may be in a repetitive region or the variant description may be inaccurate.
- **Insert Size Distribution**: Use the option to output insert size distribution plots (`--isizes-plot`) to help diagnose if the library prep characteristics match the expected support for the variant.
- **Long Read Support**: While svviz supports PacBio and Nanopore data, ensure you use the appropriate alignment parameters or wrappers if provided in the version's documentation to handle the higher error rates.
- **Transition to svviz2**: For new projects, consider checking if your requirements are better met by `svviz2`, which is the successor to the original tool and includes updated algorithms and documentation.
