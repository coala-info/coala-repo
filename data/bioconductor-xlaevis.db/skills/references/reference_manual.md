xlaevisACCNUM

Map Manufacturer identifiers to Accession Numbers

Description

xlaevisACCNUM is an R object that contains mappings between a manufacturer’s identifiers and
manufacturers accessions.

Details

For chip packages such as this, the ACCNUM mapping comes directly from the manufacturer. This
is different from other mappings which are mapped onto the probes via an Entrez Gene identifier.

Each manufacturer identifier maps to a vector containing a GenBank accession number.

Mappings were based on data provided by: Entrez Gene ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/DATA With
a date stamp from the source of: 2015-Sep27

xlaevisCHR

Map Manufacturer IDs to Chromosomes

Description

xlaevisCHR is an R object that provides mappings between a manufacturer identifier and the chro-
mosome that contains the gene of interest.

Details

Each manufacturer identifier maps to a vector of chromosomes. Due to inconsistencies that may
exist at the time the object was built, the vector may contain more than one chromosome (e.g., the
identifier may map to more than one chromosome). If the chromosomal location is unknown, the
vector will contain an NA.

xlaevisENTREZID

Map between Manufacturer Identifiers and Entrez Gene

Description

xlaevisENTREZID is an R object that provides mappings between manufacturer identifiers and
Entrez Gene identifiers.

Details

Each manufacturer identifier is mapped to a vector of Entrez Gene identifiers. An NA is assigned to
those manufacturer identifiers that can not be mapped to an Entrez Gene identifier at this time.

If a given manufacturer identifier can be mapped to different Entrez Gene identifiers from various
sources, we attempt to select the common identifiers. If a concensus cannot be determined, we
select the smallest identifier.

xlaevisENZYME

Maps between Manufacturer IDs and Enzyme Commission (EC) Num-
bers

Description

xlaevisENZYME is an R object that provides mappings between manufacturer identifiers and EC
numbers. xlaevisENZYME2PROBE is an R object that maps Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers
to manufacturer identifiers.

Details

When the xlaevisENZYME maping viewed as a list, each manufacturer identifier maps to a named
vector containing the EC number that corresponds to the enzyme produced by that gene. The names
corresponds to the manufacturer identifiers. If this information is unknown, the vector will contain
an NA.
For the xlaevisENZYME2PROBE, each EC number maps to a named vector containing all of the
manufacturer identifiers that correspond to the gene that produces that enzyme. The name of the
vector corresponds to the EC number.

Enzyme Commission numbers are assigned by the Nomenclature Committee of the International
Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology http://www.chem.qmw.ac.uk/iubmb/enzyme/ to
allow enzymes to be identified.

An Enzyme Commission number is of the format EC x.y.z.w, where x, y, z, and w are numeric
numbers. In xlaevisENZYME2PROBE, EC is dropped from the Enzyme Commission numbers.

Enzyme Commission numbers have corresponding names that describe the functions of enzymes
in such a way that EC x is a more general description than EC x.y that in turn is a more general
description than EC x.y.z. The top level EC numbers and names are listed below:

EC 1 oxidoreductases

EC 2 transferases

EC 3 hydrolases

EC 4 lyases

EC 5 isomerases

EC 6 ligases
The EC name for a given EC number can be viewed at http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iupac/
jcbn/index.html#6

xlaevisGENENAME

Map between Manufacturer IDs and Genes

Description

xlaevisGENENAME is an R object that maps manufacturer identifiers to the corresponding gene
name.

Details

Each manufacturer identifier maps to a named vector containing the gene name. The vector name
corresponds to the manufacturer identifier. If the gene name is unknown, the vector will contain an
NA.
Gene names currently include both the official (validated by a nomenclature committee) and pre-
ferred names (interim selected for display) for genes. Efforts are being made to differentiate the
two by adding a name to the vector.

xlaevisGO

Maps between manufacturer IDs and Gene Ontology (GO) IDs

Description

xlaevisGO is an R object that provides mappings between manufacturer identifiers and the GO
identifiers that they are directly associated with. This mapping and its reverse mapping (xlae-
visGO2PROBE) do NOT associate the child terms from the GO ontology with the gene. Only the
directly evidenced terms are represented here.

xlaevisGO2ALLPROBES is an R object that provides mappings between a given GO identifier and
all of the manufacturer identifiers annotated at that GO term OR TO ONE OF IT’S CHILD NODES
in the GO ontology. Thus, this mapping is much larger and more inclusive than xlaevisGO2PROBE.

Details

If xlaevisGO is cast as a list, each manufacturer identifier is mapped to a list of lists. The names on
the outer list are GO identifiers. Each inner list consists of three named elements: GOID, Ontology,
and Evidence.

The GOID element matches the GO identifier named in the outer list and is included for convenience
when processing the data using ’lapply’.

The Ontology element indicates which of the three Gene Ontology categories this identifier belongs
to. The categories are biological process (BP), cellular component (CC), and molecular function
(MF).

The Evidence element contains a code indicating what kind of evidence supports the association of
the GO identifier to the manufacturer id. Some of the evidence codes in use include:

IMP: inferred from mutant phenotype

IGI: inferred from genetic interaction

IPI: inferred from physical interaction

xlaevisGO

7

ISS: inferred from sequence similarity

IDA: inferred from direct assay

IEP: inferred from expression pattern

IEA: inferred from electronic annotation

TAS: traceable author statement

NAS: non-traceable author statement

ND: no biological data available

IC: inferred by curator

A more complete listing of evidence codes can be found at:
http://www.geneontology.org/GO.evidence.shtml

If xlaevisGO2ALLPROBES or xlaevisGO2PROBE is cast as a list, each GO term maps to a named
vector of manufacturer identifiers and evidence codes. A GO identifier may be mapped to the
same manufacturer identifier more than once but the evidence code can be different. Mappings
between Gene Ontology identifiers and Gene Ontology terms and other information are available in
a separate data package named GO.

Whenever any of these mappings are cast as a data.frame, all the results will be output in an appro-
priate tabular form.

Mappings between manufacturer identifiers and GO information were obtained through their map-
pings to manufacturer identifiers. NAs are assigned to manufacturer identifiers that can not be
mapped to any Gene Ontology information. Mappings between Gene Ontology identifiers an Gene
Ontology terms and other information are available in a separate data package named GO.

All mappings were based on data provided by: Gene Ontology ftp://ftp.geneontology.org/pub/go/godatabase/archive/latest-
lite/ With a date stamp from the source of: 20150919

xlaevisMAPCOUNTS

Number of mapped keys for the maps in package xlaevis.db

Description

DEPRECATED. Counts in the MAPCOUNT table are out of sync and should not be used.

xlaevisMAPCOUNTS provides the "map count" (i.e. the count of mapped keys) for each map in
package xlaevis.db.

Details

DEPRECATED. Counts in the MAPCOUNT table are out of sync and should not be used.

This "map count" information is precalculated and stored in the package annotation DB. This allows
some quality control and is used by the checkMAPCOUNTS function defined in AnnotationDbi to com-
pare and validate different methods (like count.mappedkeys(x) or sum(!is.na(as.list(x))))
for getting the "map count" of a given map.

xlaevisORGANISM

The Organism information for xlaevis

Description

xlaevisORGANISM is an R object that contains a single item: a character string that names the
organism for which xlaevis was built. xlaevisORGPKG is an R object that contains a chararcter
vector with the name of the organism package that a chip package depends on for its gene-centric
annotation.

xlaevisPATH

Details

9

Although the package name is suggestive of the organism for which it was built, xlaevisORGAN-
ISM provides a simple way to programmatically extract the organism name. xlaevisORGPKG
provides a simple way to programmatically extract the name of the parent organism package. The
parent organism package is a strict dependency for chip packages as this is where the gene cetric
information is ultimately extracted from. The full package name will always be this string plus the
extension ".db". But most programatic acces will not require this extension, so its more convenient
to leave it out.

xlaevisPMID

Maps between Manufacturer Identifiers and PubMed Identifiers

Description

xlaevisPMID is an R object that provides mappings between manufacturer identifiers and PubMed
identifiers. xlaevisPMID2PROBE is an R object that provides mappings between PubMed identi-
fiers and manufacturer identifiers.

Details

When xlaevisPMID is viewed as a list each manufacturer identifier is mapped to a named vector of
PubMed identifiers. The name associated with each vector corresponds to the manufacturer identi-
fier. The length of the vector may be one or greater, depending on how many PubMed identifiers a
given manufacturer identifier is mapped to. An NA is reported for any manufacturer identifier that
cannot be mapped to a PubMed identifier.

When xlaevisPMID2PROBE is viewed as a list each PubMed identifier is mapped to a named vector
of manufacturer identifiers. The name represents the PubMed identifier and the vector contains all
manufacturer identifiers that are represented by that PubMed identifier. The length of the vector
may be one or longer, depending on how many manufacturer identifiers are mapped to a given
PubMed identifier.
