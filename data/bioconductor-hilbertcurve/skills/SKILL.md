# bioconductor-hilbertcurve

name: bioconductor-hilbertcurve
description: Visualizing high-dimensional or long 1D data (like genomic sequences or large datasets) using Hilbert space-filling curves. Use this skill when you need to map 1D coordinates to a 2D space to preserve locality and improve visualization resolution, especially for genomic data, methylation patterns, or large-scale sequence analysis.

# bioconductor-hilbertcurve

## Overview
The `HilbertCurve` package transforms one-dimensional data into a two-dimensional space using the Hilbert curve. This technique is particularly effective for visualizing data with a long axis (like a chromosome) because it increases the resolution from $n$ to $\sqrt{n}$ while maintaining the locality of data points. It supports two modes: a "normal" mode for low-level graphics (points, rectangles, text) and a "pixel" mode for high-resolution data (e.g., whole-genome tracks).

## Core Workflow

### 1. Initialization
Create a curve object by specifying the data range and the "level" (which determines the resolution, $4^{level}$ segments).

```r
library(HilbertCurve)
# Normal mode for general data
hc = HilbertCurve(low = 1, high = 1000, level = 4, reference = TRUE)

# Genomic mode for biological data
library(GenomicRanges)
hc_geo = GenomicHilbertCurve(chr = "chr1", species = "hg19", level = 6)
```

### 2. Adding Data Layers
Use low-level functions to add graphics. Most functions accept `x1` and `x2` (or a `GRanges` object for genomic curves).

*   **Points:** `hc_points(hc, x1, x2, shape = "circle")`
*   **Rectangles:** `hc_rect(hc, x1, x2, gp = gpar(fill = "red"))`
*   **Segments:** `hc_segments(hc, x1, x2)`
*   **Text:** `hc_text(hc, x1, x2, labels = "label")`
*   **Polygons:** `hc_polygon(hc, x1, x2)`

### 3. High-Resolution "Pixel" Mode
For very large datasets (e.g., level > 10), use `mode = "pixel"`. This treats every segment as a pixel in an RGB matrix.

```r
hc = HilbertCurve(1, 1000000, level = 10, mode = "pixel")
hc_layer(hc, x1 = start_vec, x2 = end_vec, col = color_vec)
```

## Key Concepts and Parameters

### Averaging Models (`mean_mode`)
When multiple data points fall into a single curve segment/pixel, you must choose how to summarize them:
*   `absolute`: Simple mean of values.
*   `weighted`: Mean weighted by the width of the intersection.
*   `w0`: Weighted mean including background (uncovered) areas.
*   `max_freq`: For discrete data, picks the most frequent value.

### Genomic Specifics
*   **Multiple Chromosomes:** Pass a vector to `chr` (e.g., `chr = paste0("chr", 1:22)`) to visualize the whole genome in one curve.
*   **Chromosome Maps:** Use `hc_map(hc, add = TRUE)` to overlay chromosome boundaries and labels on the curve.

### Color Overlays
In pixel mode, you can define custom `overlay` functions to handle how new layers interact with existing ones (e.g., changing the color of overlapping regions to purple).

```r
hc_layer(hc, gr, col = "blue", overlay = function(r0, g0, b0, r, g, b, alpha) {
    # r0, g0, b0 are background; r, g, b are new layer
    # Return a list(r, g, b)
})
```

## Tips for Success
*   **Resolution:** A level 11 curve on human Chromosome 1 provides ~60bp per pixel.
*   **Legends:** Use the `ComplexHeatmap` package's `Legend()` function and pass it to the `legend` argument in the `HilbertCurve()` constructor.
*   **Non-Integer Positions:** The package handles large numbers (e.g., total genome length) and non-integers automatically.
