diffGeneAnalysis package (DGAP) is part of the Bioconductor Project. It
can be accessed at www.bioconductor.org.The objective of the package is
to analyze gene data from micro arrays.The package can be used on data
obtained from cDNA arrays as well as affymetrix chips.We intorduce new
algorithms for normalizing the microarray data and adjusting the data for
bais that can creep in due to various reasons like dye bias, hybridization
efficacy,personnel change etc.This package uses the associative T method
for performing the differential gene analysis.Details on this method can be
obtained form the paper(i) in the refernces.

2 Usage of DGAP

(i) DGAP is used on the raw gene intensities obtained from micro arrays.
The data is first subjected to normalization using our normalize function.

Normalization of data is done utilizing information obtained from background
fluorescence. Background fluoresce intensity values are used to determine
a Gaussian distribution of lowly expressed genes, yielding the background
estimates (mean and standard deviation).

(ii) Bias adjustment of the normalized data is performed using our bias
Adjust function that takes a normalized dataset and applies a multiplicative
scalar derived from the data to help account for expression biases. These
expression biases can come from many sources including dye bias, hybridiza-
tion efficacy, changes in personnel, etc. After bias adjustment the data is
ready for differential gene analysis.

(iii) Differential gene analysis of the normalized, bias adjusted data is
done using our refGroup function. refGroup performs differential gene anal-
ysis in two steps using the associative-T analysis method. The first step is
to compute the reference group, which is used as the internal standard for
associative analysis and the second and final step is to apply the associative
analysis and classify the gene expressions into four groups.

3 Explanation of Results

The results are displayed in a 10 column matrix as follows:

Column Representation.
1 Gene Bank ID
2 Average Signal of the Control Chips/Channels.
3 SD of Control Chips/Channels.
4 Probability that a given gene in the Control Chips/Channels Belongs

or doesn´t belong to background.

5 Average Signal of the Experimental Chips or Channels.
6 SD of Experimental Chips or Channels.
7 Probability that a given gene in the Experimental Chips or Channels

belong or don´t belong to background.
8 P value from a Student T-test.
9 P value from an Associative T-test.
10 Ratio of mean expression values (Control/Experimental).
11 Group Number.
Group Numbers are defined as follows A1 Expressed above background in
both sample types but over expressed on the Experimental Chips/Channels
A2 Expressed above background in both sample types but over expressed

on the Control Chips/Channels

A3 Expressed above background only on the Experimental Chips/Channel.
A4 Expressed above background only in the Control Chips/Channel.

4 Getting Started

(i) Download the package from bioconductor or directly from our website at
http:

(ii) Unzip the downloaded file and save it under your R/rw2000/library

folders.

(iii) In your R window type load (diffGeneAnalysis) .
(iv) To get help try help(normalize) (or) help(biasAdjust) (or) help(refGroup)
(v) The package can be used in totality or in combination with other tools.
The package is divided into three modules namely: normalize biasAdjust
and refGroup. One can use other normalization and bias adjustment tools
before using associative analysis method (refGroup). The following steps are
required to use this package in its entirety.

(vi) Save the micro array data into an Excel sheet and save it in .csv

format.

(vii) The first column always consists of the Gene bank Id. Loss of the

first chip data may occur if it is missing.

(viii) The first row consists of row headers. Row headers can be avoided
by reading the data into R having the option header=FALSE. Loss of gene
1 data can occur if headers are missing while option header=TRUE. It is
advised to enter headers for good documentation and readability purposes.
(ix) The control chips are always saved first after Gene ID column (2nd
column onwards), followed by experimental chip data in the excel sheet from
left to right. Any other combination will not work. No blank columns or
blank rows are allowed.

(x) The following command is suggested to read the data from the saved

excel sheet(.csv format) into R. rawdata<-read.csv("c:/Book1.csv",sep=",",header=TRUE).
To run the examples load the following data provided with the package.
data(rawdata) The following sweave style vignette shows how to load a sam-
ple dataset(rawdata) and normalize data,bias adjust the normalized data and
perform differential gene expression using our associative analysis method.

R> library(diffGeneAnalysis) ##load the diffGeneAnalysis package

load the sample dataset (rawdata) to run the example.

R>data(rawdata)

normalize the sample data set. When prompted with a graph of 6 his-
tograms. Select the best mean by observing the right half of the Gaussian
fit. Confirm your slection,else reselect the proper histogram fit. Repeat this
procedure for as many chips as the dataset consists of.

R>normalized<-normalize(rawdata,7,3,4,0.15,0.60)

bias adjust the normalized data set.Please note that this function can take
upto 20 seconds to run on a large 22400 gene set on a Pentium IV 1.6Ghz,
128MB Ram.

R>bAdjusted<-biasAdjust(normalized,7)

Perform the associative analysis on the normalized and bias adjusted data
set to differentiate gene expressions into groups. The user will be prompted
for E and R values. E stand for the increase in fold over background and R
stands for the ratio of experimental chips average over control chips average.
The higher these values the higher will be the stringency. Example dataset
used here was run with an E values of 1 and R value of 1.5 Please note
that this function can take upto 40 seconds to run on a 22400 gene set on a
pentium IV 1.6Ghz and 128MB RAM.

R>results<-refGroup(bAdjusted,7,3,4,0.05)

(xi) normalized<-normalize(rawdata,7,3,4,0.15,0.60) normalizing the data.
Rawdata is loaded in the package to use as an example. Read data docu-
mentation for details.

(xii) bAdjusted<-biasAdjust(normalized,7) bias adjusting the normalized

data. normalized is loaded in the package for use as an example.

(xiii) results<-refGroup(bAdjusted,7,3,4,0.05) performing associative anal-

ysis after creating the internal standard(refernce group).

(xiv) Write the results into an excel sheet from R for readability and

archiving purposes.

(xv) write.table(results, file = "c:/results.csv", sep = ",", col.names =

NA)

(xvi) Open results.csv created in the "c:/" directory/ any other directory

that u selected and analyze the results.

Note: In order to use the package in its entirety follow steps (x) to (xvi)
in the same sequence. If the user decides to use other normalization and bias
adjustment methods, save the normalized/ bias adjusted data in an excel file
in the .csv format and follow steps (xii) to (xvi) sequentially.
