# Assembler-specific examples

This page guides you through using the assembler-specific contig graph representations provided by the *agtools* API, along with detailed insights into how contig graphs are constructed.

## SPAdes contig graph

Here is an example SPAdes graph. Note that this is not a real SPAdes graph.

```
H   VN:Z:1.0
S   8925540 ACGTAC
S   8925544 CGTACGT
S   8925548 GTACGTA
S   8925552 TACGTAG
L   8925540 +   8925544 +   5M
L   8925544 +   8925548 +   5M
L   8925548 +   8925552 +   5M
P   NODE_1_length_13_cov_20.0   8925540+,8925544+   5M,5M
P   NODE_2_length_21_cov_18.5   8925544+,8925548+,8925552+  5M,5M,5M
```

SPAdes generates a unitig graph and resolves longer paths as contigs. *agtools* builds the contig graph based on prefix and suffix matching of contigs, *i.e.*, if the last segment of the first contig is the same as the first segment of the second contig, then a link between the two contigs is created. For example path `NODE_1_length_13_cov_20.0` ends with segment `8925544` and path `NODE_2_length_21_cov_18.5` starts with `8925544`.

You can load a SPAdes contig graph as follows. We will use the [test data](https://github.com/Vini2/agtools/tree/main/tests/data/ESC) provided.

```
>>> from agtools.assemblers import spades
>>> graph_file = "tests/data/ESC/assembly_graph_with_scaffolds.gfa"
>>> contigs_file = "tests/data/ESC/contigs.fasta"
>>> contig_paths_file = "tests/data/ESC/contigs.paths"
>>> cg = spades.get_contig_graph(graph_file, contigs_file, contig_paths_file)
```

You can check the number of vertices (contigs) and edges (connections).

```
>>> cg.vcount
189
>>> cg.ecount
394
```

Note

You will note that there are less number of contigs than segments (`S` tags) in the graph (189 contigs and 982 segments in this example). This is because SPAdes resolves longer segment paths as contigs. Each contig is made up of one or more segments.

Note

You will note that there are less number of edges than links (`L` tags) in the graph (394 edges and 1318 links in this example). This is because *agtools* only represent prefix-suffix overlaps of contigs. Also, the graph is undirected and simplified to remove multiple edges and self loops.

## MEGAHIT contig graph

MEGAHIT assembly graphs represent contig sequences as segments and overlaps between contigs as links. So it is pretty straightforward to understand. However, when building the graph file from `megahit_core`, the contigs are renamed.

For example, this is how the first few lines of `final.contigs.fa` looks like.

```
>k141_4704 flag=0 multi=1.0000 len=301
TTCTGCAACACTTAAAGACATTCAAACTTTTTATGTTTGGGGTTACTGTAAAAACGATCAAATTAAGTGGTCCGTAGCCAAGGGTTTAATCGATAAAGAAGAATACACTTTGATCACTGGAGAAAAATATCCAGAAACAAAAGATGAAAAGTCACAGGTGTAATACTTGTGGCTTTTTAATTTGAATAAAGTGGGTGGCATAATGTTTGGATTTACCAAACGACATGAACAAGATTGGAGTTTAACGCGATTAGAAGAAAATGATAAGACTATGTTTGAAAAATTCGACAGAATAGAAGAT

...
```

And this is how the first few lines of `final.graph.fastg` looks like.

```

```

`k141_4704` corresponds to `NODE_1_length_205_cov_1.0000_ID_1` and `k141_10879` corresponds to `NODE_2_length_301_cov_1.0000_ID_3`. Hence, the `megahit` module of *agtools* is designed to handle these differences in contig names as well.

Once you convert the FASTG file to GFA format, you can load a MEGAHIT contig graph as follows. We will use the [test data](https://github.com/Vini2/agtools/tree/main/tests/data/ESC) provided.

```
>>> from agtools.assemblers import megahit
>>> graph_file = "tests/data/5G/final.gfa"
>>> contig_file = "tests/data/5G/final.contigs.fa"
>>> cg = megahit.get_contig_graph(graph_file, contig_file)
```

You can get the contig name mapping between the graph file and the FASTA file as follows.

```
>>> cg.graph_to_contig_map
bidict({'NODE_1_length_205_cov_1.0000_ID_1': 'k141_4704', 'NODE_2_length_301_cov_1.0000_ID_3': 'k141_10879', 'NODE_3_length_301_cov_1.0000_ID_5': 'k141_9891', ...})
```

Given the contig name in the graph, you can get the contig name in the FASTA file as follows.

```
>>> cg.graph_to_contig_map['NODE_1_length_301_cov_1.0000_ID_1']
'k141_4704'
```

You can query the other way round as well. Given the contig name in the FASTA file, you can get the contig name in the graph as follows.

```
>>> cg.graph_to_contig_map.inverse['k141_4704']
['NODE_1_length_205_cov_1.0000_ID_1']
```

Note

`graph_to_contig_map` is a bidirectional dictionary. Hence you can query both ways; contig names in graph to FASTA and in FASTA to graph.

You can get the contig sequences using the contig name in the graph as follows.

```
>>> cg.get_contig_sequence('NODE_1_length_205_cov_1.0000_ID_1')
Seq('CGCCCTCGCTCATGCACGATTGCGAAGGCTCCGGCATGCCATCTGAAGAAACAG...GAA')
```

Note that the contigs have some descriptions after the name in the FASTA file. You can get them as follows.

```
>>> cg.contig_descriptions['k141_4704']
'k141_4704 flag=0 multi=1.0000 len=205'
```

## Flye contig graph

Flye assembly graphs follows a similar structure to that of SPAdes. The main difference is that links are direct continuations instead of overlaps. Similar to SPAdes, *agtools* builds the contig graph based on prefix and suffix matching of contigs, *i.e.*, if the last segment of the first contig is the same as the first segment of the second contig, then a link between the two contigs is created.

You can load a Flye contig graph as follows. We will use the [test data](https://github.com/Vini2/agtools/tree/main/tests/data/1Y3B) provided.

```
>>> from agtools.assemblers import flye
>>> graph_file = "tests/data/1Y3B/assembly_graph.gfa"
>>> contigs_file = "tests/data/1Y3B/assembly.fasta"
>>> contig_paths_file = "tests/data/1Y3B/assembly_info.txt"
>>> cg = flye.get_contig_graph(graph_file, contigs_file, contig_paths_file)
```

You can check the number of vertices (contigs), edges (connections) and number of link lines in the GFA file.

```
>>> cg.vcount
67
>>> cg.ecount
2
>>> cg.lcount
10
```

Note

You will note that there are less number of contigs than segments (`S` tags) in the graph (67 contigs and 69 segments in this example). This is because SPAdes resolves longer segment paths as contigs. Each contig is made up of one or more segments.

Note

You will note that there are less number of edges than links (`L` tags) in the graph (2 edges and 10 links in this example). This is because *agtools* only represent prefix-suffix overlaps of contigs. Also, the graph is undirected and simplified to remove duplicate edges.

## myloasm contig graph

myloasm assembly graphs represent contig sequences as segments and overlaps between contigs as links. So it is pretty straightforward to represent contig graphs.

```
>>> from agtools.assemblers import myloasm
>>> graph_file = "tests/data/myloasm/final_contig_graph.gfa"
>>> contigs_file = "tests/data/myloasm/assembly_primary.fa"
>>> cg = myloasm.get_contig_graph(graph_file, contigs_file)
```

Warning

Not all contigs in the `final_contig_graph.gfa` file appear in the `assembly_primary.fa` as contigs that are similar to larger contigs are removed (see [GitHub issue](https://github.com/bluenote-1577/myloasm/issues/5)). Also, the contig sequences are not present in the GFA file. This can raise warnings when retrieving contig sequences. Hence, it is recommended to run `agtools clean` to remove missing contigs and add back the contig sequences to the GFA file.

You can check the number of vertices (contigs), edges (connections), the number of link lines and contig names.

```
>>> cg.vcount
2
>>> cg.ecount
1
>>> cg.lcount
2
>>> cg.contig_names
['u913838ctg', 'u579439ctg']
>>> cg.contig_name_to_id
{'u913838ctg': 0, 'u579439ctg': 1}
```
