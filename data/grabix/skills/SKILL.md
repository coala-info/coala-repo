# grabix

## Overview
grabix is a lightweight command-line utility that provides random access to text files compressed with `bgzip`. By generating a custom index file (`.gbi`), it allows for nearly instantaneous retrieval of arbitrary lines or ranges. This tool is an essential alternative to standard `zcat | sed` pipelines, which are prohibitively slow for large datasets because they require linear decompression.

## Core Commands and Usage

### 1. Preparation and Indexing
Before using grabix for retrieval, the target file must be compressed with `bgzip` (part of the samtools/htslib suite) and then indexed by grabix.

*   **Compress a file**:
    `bgzip input.bed`
*   **Create a grabix index**:
    `grabix index input.bed.gz`
    *Note: This creates a companion file named `input.bed.gz.gbi`.*

### 2. Extracting Specific Lines
Line numbers in grabix are 1-based.

*   **Extract a single line (e.g., line 100)**:
    `grabix grab input.bed.gz 100`
*   **Extract a range of lines (e.g., lines 100 through 110)**:
    `grabix grab input.bed.gz 100 110`

### 3. Random Sampling
Grabix uses reservoir sampling to select random lines efficiently.

*   **Extract 100 random lines**:
    `grabix random input.bed.gz 100`

### 4. File Inspection
*   **Get total line count**:
    `grabix size input.bed.gz`
*   **Verify BGZF format**:
    `grabix check input.bed.gz`
    *Use this to confirm if a `.gz` file was compressed with `bgzip` or standard `gzip` (which grabix cannot index).*

## Expert Tips and Best Practices
*   **Standard Gzip Incompatibility**: grabix only works with BGZF files. If `grabix check` returns an error, you must recompress the file using `bgzip`.
*   **Header Handling**: grabix treats headers like any other line. If your file has a header, line 1 will be the header.
*   **Performance**: The `.gbi` index is much smaller than the original file but allows for O(1) or near O(1) access time to any position in the file.
*   **Pipe Support**: While grabix is designed for random access to files on disk, you can pipe its output into other tools (e.g., `grabix grab file.gz 1 1000 | sort -k1,1 -k2,2n`).
