name: rnftools
description: RNFtools generates and evaluates simulated Next-Generation Sequencing data by encoding genomic coordinates directly into read names using the RNF framework. Use when user asks to simulate reads from reference genomes, convert existing datasets to RNF-compliant formats, or evaluate the mapping accuracy of bioinformatic aligners using ROC curves.

# rnftools

## Overview

This skill enables the generation and evaluation of simulated Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) data using the RNF framework. RNFtools provides a standardized way to encode genomic coordinates directly into read names, allowing for seamless evaluation of mapping accuracy without the need for external truth files. Use this tool to create complex simulated datasets from reference genomes and to generate ROC curves or other performance metrics for various bioinformatic aligners.

## Core Functionalities

### Read Simulation (rnf-sim)
RNFtools can simulate reads using various backends (like Art, Dwgsim, or Mason) while ensuring the output follows the RNF naming convention.

- **Basic Simulation**: Define a "genome" and "reads" to generate FASTQ files where the read names contain the exact source coordinates.
- **Coverage-based Sampling**: Specify desired fold coverage or a fixed number of read pairs.
- **Error Profiles**: Configure sequencing error rates and insert size distributions to mimic specific platforms (Illumina, Ion Torrent, etc.).

### Format Conversion (rnf-conv)
Convert existing simulated datasets or BAM files into RNF-compliant formats.
- Use this to "RNFize" reads from simulators that do not natively support the format.
- Extract mapping information from BAM files to create RNF-compliant FASTQ files for re-evaluation.

### Evaluation and Benchmarking (rnf-eval)
Compare the output of different mappers against the "truth" encoded in the RNF read names.
- **Accuracy Assessment**: Determine if a read is mapped correctly based on a distance threshold (e.g., within 20bp of the true origin).
- **Visualization**: Generate SVG or PDF reports containing ROC curves (Sensitivity vs. False Discovery Rate) to compare the precision of different alignment algorithms or parameter sets.

## Best Practices

- **Reference Consistency**: Ensure the same reference genome version is used for both simulation and subsequent mapping to avoid coordinate mismatches.
- **Read Name Integrity**: Avoid tools that strip or truncate read names during processing, as the RNF metadata is stored entirely within the string preceding the first space in the FASTQ header.
- **Evaluation Thresholds**: When running evaluations, adjust the "allowed distance" parameter based on the complexity of the genomic region (e.g., increase it for highly repetitive regions or long-read simulations).



## Subcommands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| rnftools art2rnf | Convert an Art SAM file to RNF-FASTQ. Note that Art produces non-standard SAM files and manual editation might be necessary. In particular, when a FASTA file contains comments, Art left them in the sequence name. Comments must be removed in their corresponding @SQ headers in the SAM file, otherwise all reads are considered to be unmapped by this script. |
| rnftools curesim2rnf | Convert a CuReSim FASTQ file to RNF-FASTQ. |
| rnftools dwgsim2rnf | Convert a DwgSim FASTQ file (dwgsim_prefix.bfast.fastq) to RNF-FASTQ. |
| rnftools es2et | todo |
| rnftools et2roc | todo |
| rnftools liftover | Liftover genomic coordinates in RNF names in a SAM/BAM files or in a FASTQ file. |
| rnftools mason2rnf | Convert a Mason SAM file to RNF-FASTQ. |
| rnftools merge | todo |
| rnftools sam2es | todo |
| rnftools sam2rnf | Convert a SAM/BAM file to RNF-FASTQ. |
| rnftools sam2roc | todo |
| rnftools validate | Validate RNF names in a FASTQ file. |
| rnftools wgsim2rnf | Convert WgSim FASTQ files to RNF-FASTQ. |
