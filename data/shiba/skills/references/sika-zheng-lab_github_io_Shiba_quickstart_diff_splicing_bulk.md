# Differential RNA splicing analysis with bulk RNA-seq data[¶](#differential-rna-splicing-analysis-with-bulk-rna-seq-data "Permanent link")

---

## Before you start[¶](#before-you-start "Permanent link")

* Perform mapping of RNA-seq reads to the reference genome and generate bam files with their index files (`.bai`) by software such as [STAR](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR) and [HISAT2](https://daehwankimlab.github.io/hisat2/).
  + You can download test RNA-seq bam files with their index (two replicates for reference and alternative groups) mapped by STAR on the mouse genome from [here](https://zenodo.org/records/14976391).
* Download a gene annotataion file of your interest in GTF format.

## Shiba[¶](#shiba "Permanent link")

### 1. Prepare inputs[¶](#1-prepare-inputs "Permanent link")

`experiment.tsv`: A **tab-separated** text file of sample ID, path to bam files, and groups for differential analysis.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 ``` | ``` sample  bam group Ref_1 /path/to/workdir/bam/Ref_1.bam  Ref Ref_2 /path/to/workdir/bam/Ref_2.bam  Ref Alt_1 /path/to/workdir/bam/Alt_1.bam  Alt Alt_2 /path/to/workdir/bam/Alt_2.bam  Alt ``` |

Make sure to use tabs

If you copy and paste the above example, your experiment.tsv file may contain **spaces** instead of tabs, which will causes an error when you run **Shiba**. Please make sure that you are using a **tab** character between the columns.

Shiba supports long-read RNA-seq data

If you have **long-read RNA-seq data** (i.e., PacBio or ONT), please add the 4th column to the `experiment.tsv` file with the value `long` for long-read data and `short` for short-read data. For example:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 ``` | ``` sample bam group technology Ref_1 /path/to/workdir/bam/Ref_1.bam Ref short Ref_2 /path/to/workdir/bam/Ref_2.bam Ref long Alt_1 /path/to/workdir/bam/Alt_1.bam Alt short Alt_2 /path/to/workdir/bam/Alt_2.bam Alt long ``` |

The 4th column is optional. If you do not have long-read data, you can omit the 4th column. Blank values are also accepted and will be treated as `short`.

Use long-read data only for discovery of alternative RNA splicing events

If you want to use long-read RNA-seq data only for discovery of alternative RNA splicing events and **NOT** for differential analysis, you can set the 3rd column to different values than that of short-read data. For example, if you want to perform differential splicing analysis between `Ref` and `Alt` groups using short-read data, you can set `Ref` and `Alt` for short-read data, and set `Ref_long` and `Alt_long` for long-read data, so that the long-read data will be used only for transcript assembly and not for differential analysis.

`config.yaml`: A yaml file of the configuration.

### 2. Run[¶](#2-run "Permanent link")

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 ``` | ``` shiba.py -p 4 config.yaml ``` |

You are going to use 4 threads for parallelization. You can change the number of threads by changing the `-p` option.

Did you encounter any problems?

You can run **Shiba** with the `--verbose` option to see the debug log. This will help you to find the problem.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 ``` | ``` shiba.py --verbose -p 4 config.yaml ``` |

If you continue to encounter issues, please don't hesitate to [open an issue](https://github.com/Sika-Zheng-Lab/Shiba/issues) on GitHub. The community and developers are here to help!

## MameShiba[¶](#mameshiba "Permanent link")

**MameShiba** is a lightweight version of **Shiba** that can be run on a local machine without Docker or Singularity. It is designed for users who want to perform splicing analysis only and do not need the full functionality of **Shiba**.

### 1. Prepare inputs[¶](#1-prepare-inputs_1 "Permanent link")

`experiment.tsv`: A **tab-separated** text file of sample ID, path to bam files, and groups for differential analysis. This is the same as the input for **Shiba**.

`config.yaml`: A yaml file of the configuration. This is the same as the configuration for **Shiba**.

### 2. Run[¶](#2-run_1 "Permanent link")

Make sure running with `--mame` option.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 ``` | ``` shiba.py --mame -p 4 config.yaml ``` |

---

## SnakeShiba[¶](#snakeshiba "Permanent link")

A snakemake-based workflow of **Shiba**. This is useful for running **Shiba** on a cluster. Snakemake automatically parallelizes the jobs and manages the dependencies between them.

### 1. Prepare inputs[¶](#1-prepare-inputs_2 "Permanent link")

`experiment.tsv`: A **tab-separated** text file of sample ID, path to fastq files, and groups for differential analysis. This is the same as the input for **Shiba**.

`config.yaml`: A yaml file of the configuration. This is the same as the configuration for **Shiba** but with the addition of the `container` field and without the `only_psi` and `only_psi_group` fields as they are not supported in **SnakeShiba**.
