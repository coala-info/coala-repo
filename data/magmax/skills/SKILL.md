# magmax

## Overview
MAGmax is a specialized tool designed to maximize the recovery of genomes from metagenomic data. Unlike traditional dereplication tools that simply select a single representative bin, MAGmax can group related bins, merge them, and perform a targeted reassembly to produce a superior consensus genome. It is highly effective for consolidating fragmented bins across multiple samples into high-quality Metagenome-Assembled Genomes (MAGs).

## Core Workflows

### 1. Full Dereplication with Reassembly (Default)
This is the most robust mode. It groups bins by sequence identity, merges them, and uses the original reads to reassemble a higher-quality bin.
- **Required Inputs**: Bins directory (`-b`), Reads directory (`-r`), and Mapping ID directory (`-m`).
- **Command**:
  ```bash
  magmax -b ./bins_dir -r ./reads_dir -m ./mapid_dir -f fasta -t 24
  ```

### 2. Quality-Based Selection (No Reassembly)
Use this mode when you want to pick the single best bin from each cluster without the computational overhead of reassembly. It selects representatives based on a quality score: `completeness - 5 * contamination`.
- **Required Inputs**: Bins directory (`-b`) only.
- **Command**:
  ```bash
  magmax -b ./bins_dir --no-reassembly -f fasta -t 16
  ```

### 3. Sensitive Mode (Connectivity-Based)
Use this mode to prioritize genomes that are most representative of the population (highest ANI connectivity) rather than just the highest quality score. This is useful for identifying dominant strains.
- **Command**:
  ```bash
  magmax -b ./bins_dir --sensitive -f fasta
  ```

## Expert Tips and Best Practices

### Optimizing Performance
- **Pre-computed Quality**: If you have already run CheckM2, provide the report using `-q quality_report.tsv` to skip the internal quality assessment step.
- **Pre-computed ANI**: If you have skani results (from `skani triangle -E`), provide them via `--anifile ani_edges` to bypass the clustering calculation.
- **Thread Management**: Always specify `-t` to match your environment's CPU capacity, as the reassembly and ANI calculations are resource-intensive.

### Handling Input Formats
- **File Extensions**: Use `-f` to specify your bin extension (e.g., `fasta`, `fa`, `fna`).
- **Sample Splitting**: If your input bins are not already organized or named by sample ID, use the `--split` flag to ensure clusters are handled correctly across the dataset.
- **Assembler Choice**: While `spades` is the default and recommended assembler for the reassembly step, you can switch to `megahit` using `--assembler megahit` for faster but potentially less exhaustive results.

### Threshold Tuning
- **Completeness/Purity**: The defaults are 50% completeness (`-c 50`) and 95% purity (`-p 95`). For high-quality (HQ) MAG requirements, increase these to `-c 90 -p 95`.
- **Clustering Stringency**: Adjust the ANI threshold for grouping bins using `-i`. The default is 99 (99% ANI).
