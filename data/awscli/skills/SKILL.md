description: This tool provides a wrapper for the AWS CLI to interact with LocalStack services without manually specifying local endpoint URLs. Use when user asks to run AWS commands against a local environment, simulate cloud services with LocalStack, or use the awslocal utility for local development.

# awscli

## Overview

This skill streamlines local cloud development by utilizing the `awslocal` utility, a thin wrapper around the standard AWS CLI. It is designed for developers who use LocalStack to simulate AWS services on their local machines. Instead of manually appending `--endpoint-url=http://localhost:4566` to every command, this skill enables a more concise syntax that mirrors production AWS CLI usage while ensuring all requests are correctly routed to the local environment.

## Usage Patterns and Best Practices

### Basic Command Execution
The `awslocal` command maintains the exact same syntax as the standard `aws` command. Use it as a drop-down replacement for any service supported by LocalStack.

```bash
# Standard AWS CLI (Production)
aws kinesis list-streams

# LocalStack with awslocal
awslocal kinesis list-streams
```

### Configuration via Environment Variables
You can customize the behavior of the wrapper using environment variables. This is particularly useful when running LocalStack in Docker or a remote environment.

- **AWS_ENDPOINT_URL**: Set this to override the default local endpoint (e.g., `http://my-docker-host:4566`).
- **LOCALSTACK_HOST**: (Deprecated) Defines the host and port (default: `localhost:4566`).
- **DEFAULT_REGION**: Sets the target region for local requests.

### Shell Completion
To improve productivity, register command completion for `awslocal` in your shell profile (`.bashrc` or `.zshrc`):

```bash
complete -C '/usr/local/bin/aws_completer' awslocal
```

### Handling CloudFormation Limitations
There is a known limitation when using `cloudformation package` or `deploy` with AWS CLI v2, as it may fail to correctly route S3 requests to LocalStack.
- **Recommendation**: Use AWS CLI v1 for complex CloudFormation workflows involving S3 artifacts.
- **Workaround**: If using CLI v2, you may need to manually specify the S3 endpoint or use the standard `aws` command with explicit flags if the wrapper's automatic patching fails.

### Lightweight Alternative (Alias)
If you cannot install the `awscli-local` package, you can achieve similar (though less robust) functionality using a shell alias:

```bash
alias awslocal="AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=test AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=test AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=${DEFAULT_REGION:-$AWS_DEFAULT_REGION} aws --endpoint-url=http://${LOCALSTACK_HOST:-localhost}:4566"
```
*Note: This alias does not include the specialized S3 endpoint patching required for certain CloudFormation commands.*

## Expert Tips
- **Debug Mode**: If a command fails, run with the standard AWS `--debug` flag. `awslocal` version 0.22.2+ suppresses full stack traces by default to match standard CLI behavior unless debug mode is active.
- **Credential Handling**: `awslocal` automatically uses "test" as the default for access keys and secrets if they are not found in your environment, ensuring commands work out-of-the-box without real AWS credentials.
