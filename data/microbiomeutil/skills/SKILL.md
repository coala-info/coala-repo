# microbiomeutil

## Overview

The `microbiomeutil` skill provides a streamlined interface for the `microbiomeutilities` R package, which serves as a utility wrapper for `phyloseq` and `microbiome` objects. It is designed to simplify "seemingly simple" but often tedious tasks for microbiome researchers, such as cleaning taxonomic names, generating publication-quality visualizations, and handling longitudinal data structures. While the package is in maintenance mode in favor of the `miaverse` ecosystem, it remains a standard tool for processing `phyloseq` data containers.

## Core Workflows and Best Practices

### Installation and Setup
The package is primarily hosted on GitHub. Ensure the environment has `devtools` and the Bioconductor dependencies (`phyloseq`, `microbiome`) installed.

```r
# Install the utility package
devtools::install_github("microsud/microbiomeutilities")

# Load the library
library(microbiomeutilities)
```

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
One of the most common hurdles in microbiome analysis is inconsistent taxonomic labeling (e.g., "Family_unknown_genus"). Use these utilities to standardize your `phyloseq` object:

- **Taxonomic Formatting**: Use `format_to_besthit()` to replace unclassified taxonomic levels with the best available higher-level classification.
- **Sequence Management**: Use `add_refseq()` to store ASV (Amplicon Sequence Variant) sequences directly within the `phyloseq` object for better traceability.
- **Filtering**: Use `find_samples_taxa()` to identify specific samples containing particular taxa of interest.

### Advanced Visualization
The tool provides high-level wrappers for `ggplot2` to visualize community structure:

- **Heatmaps**: `plot_taxa_heatmap()` generates customizable heatmaps of taxonomic abundance.
- **Rarefaction**: `plot_alpha_rcurve()` creates alpha diversity rarefaction curves to assess sequencing depth sufficiency.
- **Abundance Distributions**: Use `plot_taxa_cv()` to visualize the coefficient of variation for taxa across samples.

### Longitudinal and Comparative Analysis
For studies with multiple time points or paired designs:

- **Spaghetti Plots**: Use `plot_spaghetti()` to visualize changes in specific taxa or diversity metrics across time points for individual subjects.
- **Paired Abundances**: `plot_paired_abundances()` is ideal for visualizing shifts between two conditions (e.g., Pre- vs. Post-treatment).
- **Area Plots**: `plot_area()` provides a clear view of compositional shifts over a continuous variable or time.

### Community Summaries
- **Dominance**: Use `dominant_taxa()` to quickly identify which taxa are most abundant in each sample or group.
- **Group Abundances**: `get_group_abundances()` calculates the mean or relative abundance of taxa aggregated by metadata categories.

## Expert Tips
- **Tibble Integration**: The package includes utilities to convert `phyloseq` slots into `tibbles`, making it easier to use `tidyverse` functions for custom data manipulation.
- **Memory Management**: When working with large datasets (e.g., thousands of ASVs), use `format_to_besthit()` early in the pipeline to reduce the complexity of downstream visualization labels.
- **Phyloseq Compatibility**: Always ensure your input object is a valid `phyloseq` class; most functions in this utility set will fail if the input is a standard data frame or matrix.
