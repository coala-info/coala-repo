# emu-pca

## Overview
EMU (Expectation-Maximization for Ultra-low coverage) is a specialized tool designed to infer population structure from genetic data that suffers from significant missingness. Unlike standard PCA methods that often require high-quality, well-called genotypes, EMU models missing data directly using a truncated Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) approach. It is particularly effective for ancient DNA (aDNA) or low-depth sequencing where "missingness" is a primary characteristic of the dataset rather than an artifact to be filtered out.

## Installation and Setup
The tool can be installed via Conda or Pip. For high-performance computing (HPC) environments, ensure the compiler flags match the architecture.

```bash
# Installation via Bioconda
conda install bioconda::emu-pca

# Installation via Pip
pip install emu-popgen
```

## Common CLI Patterns

### Basic PCA Execution
To run a standard analysis, provide the prefix of your PLINK files. EMU expects the `.bed`, `.bim`, and `.fam` files to share this prefix.

```bash
emu --bfile [prefix] --eig [n_components] --threads [n] --out [output_prefix]
```

### Advanced Eigenvector Modeling
You can specify a different number of eigenvectors for the internal modeling versus the final output. This is useful when you want to model the data structure using a few dimensions but need a larger set of components for downstream analysis.

```bash
# Model with 2 eigenvectors but output 10
emu --bfile test_data --eig 2 --eig-out 10 --threads 8 --out results
```

### Large-Scale Datasets
For very large datasets that exceed available RAM, use the memory-efficient flag. This optimizes the SVD process to reduce the memory footprint at the cost of some computational speed.

```bash
emu --mem --bfile large_dataset --eig 5 --threads 16 --out large_results
```

## Best Practices and Tips
- **Input Format**: Always ensure your data is in binary PLINK format. If you have VCF files, convert them using `plink --vcf [file] --make-bed --out [prefix]` before using EMU.
- **Thread Optimization**: EMU scales well with threads. On shared systems, match `--threads` to your allocated CPU cores to maximize the speed of the EM iterations.
- **HPC "Illegal Instruction" Errors**: If EMU fails on a cluster, it is often due to the `march=native` flag used during compilation. Reinstall from source after removing this flag in `setup.py` to ensure compatibility across different node architectures.
- **Quick Execution**: For one-off runs without a full installation, use the `uv` package manager: `uvx emu --bfile [prefix] ...`.
