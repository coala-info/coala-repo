description: This Common Workflow Language pipeline processes long-read whole genome sequencing data through quality filtering, de novo assembly with Flye, variant calling with Clair3 and FreeBayes, and comprehensive functional annotation using Bakta and Liftoff. Use this skill when you need to reconstruct complete genomes, identify structural and single-nucleotide variants, and characterize the functional or metabolic potential of organisms from long-read sequencing datasets.

# long-read-wgs-pipeline

## Overview

This Common Workflow Language (CWL) pipeline provides an end-to-end solution for long-read Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) data, encompassing quality control, de novo assembly, variant calling, and functional annotation. The process begins with raw read assessment using LongReadSum and quality/length filtering via Filtlong. For reference-guided steps, the pipeline integrates a [preprocessing sub-workflow](https://workflowhub.eu/workflows/1818) to prepare genomic files for downstream analysis.

The core of the workflow utilizes Flye for genome assembly and Minimap2 for sequence mapping. It performs dual-track variant calling, employing Clair3 for read-based variants and FreeBayes for assembly-based variants. Users can access the complete suite of underlying tool definitions and related workflows in the [SSB GitLab repository](https://git.wur.nl/ssb/automated-data-analysis/cwl/-/tree/main/workflows).

Genomic annotation is handled through several specialized components:
*   **Bakta:** Used for rapid annotation of genomes, particularly when no reference is available.
*   **Liftoff:** Performs annotation lift-over from a closely related reference genome to the new assembly.
*   **SnpEff:** Facilitates functional annotation and building/downloading required genomic databases.

Detailed documentation and version history for this pipeline are available on [WorkflowHub](https://workflowhub.eu/workflows/1868).
