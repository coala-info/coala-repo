## Overview

VILOCA (VIral LOcal haplotype reconstruction and mutation CAlling) is a specialized bioinformatics tool for resolving the genetic diversity within viral quasispecies. Unlike standard variant callers that focus on consensus sequences, VILOCA reconstructs the specific combinations of mutations (haplotypes) present in a sample. It supports both short-read and long-read technologies and offers sophisticated error-handling modes, including the ability to incorporate sequencing quality scores or learn error parameters directly from the data.

## Core Workflows

### Standard Analysis (Recommended)
For most datasets where sequencing quality scores (Phred scores) are reliable, use the `use_quality_scores` mode. This is the most robust approach for distinguishing true low-frequency variants from sequencing artifacts.

```bash
viloca run -b alignment.bam -f reference.fasta --mode use_quality_scores
```

### Amplicon Sequencing Data
If the data was generated using an amplicon-based strategy (e.g., ARTIC protocol for SARS-CoV-2), providing the insert regions is critical for accurate segmentation.

```bash
viloca run -f reference.fasta -b reads.bam -z scheme.insert.bed --mode use_quality_scores
```

### Shotgun Sequencing Data
When no amplicon scheme is available, VILOCA tiles the genome into uniform regions. Set the window size (`-w`) to approximately the average length of your reads.

```bash
viloca run -f reference.fasta -b reads.bam -w 150 --mode use_quality_scores
```

## Parameter Tuning and Best Practices

### Input Requirements
*   **Primary Alignments Only**: Ensure your BAM file contains only primary alignments. Secondary and supplementary alignments should be filtered out during preprocessing (e.g., using `samtools view -F 2308`) to prevent false haplotype reconstruction.
*   **Sorted and Indexed**: The input BAM must be coordinate-sorted and indexed.

### Handling Sequencing Errors
*   **Unreliable Quality Scores**: If you suspect the Phred scores in your BAM are inaccurate or missing, use `--mode learn_error_params` to estimate the error rate from the data itself.
*   **Frequency Filtering**: Use `--exclude_non_var_pos_threshold` to ignore noise. For example, setting it to `0.01` will treat any position with less than 1% variation as the reference base.

### Advanced Calling Options
*   **Posterior Threshold**: The `-p` parameter (default 0.9) controls the confidence level for calling variants from reconstructed haplotypes. Increase this value for higher precision or decrease it for higher sensitivity.
*   **Insertions**: By default, VILOCA focuses on SNPs and deletions. To enable insertion calling, add the `--extended_window_mode` flag.
*   **Window Overlap**: The `--win_min_ext` parameter (default 0.85) defines how much of a read must overlap a window to be included. If you have very short reads relative to your window size, you may need to lower this value.

## Output Interpretation
*   **haplotypes/**: A directory containing FASTA files for each local region. These represent the reconstructed viral variants.
*   **cooccurring_mutations.csv**: A key file for linkage analysis, showing which mutations appear together on the same physical reads/haplotypes.
*   **coverage.txt**: Provides the read depth for each analyzed window, useful for identifying regions with insufficient data for confident reconstruction.
