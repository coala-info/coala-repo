# opfi

## Overview
Opfi is a specialized bioinformatics toolkit designed to streamline the discovery of gene clusters. It operates in two primary phases: first, the **Gene Finder** uses iterative homology searches (BLAST-based) to identify genomic regions of interest; second, the **Operon Analyzer** applies user-defined biological rules and filters to these regions to identify high-confidence operon candidates. This tool is particularly useful for researchers looking for specific systems like CRISPR-Cas or metabolic pathways in large-scale metagenomic data.

## Core Workflows

### 1. Gene Finder Pipeline
The Gene Finder identifies clusters by starting from a "seed" gene and looking for neighboring genes that match specific profiles.

```python
from gene_finder.pipeline import Pipeline
import os

# Initialize the pipeline
p = Pipeline()

# 1. Add a seed step (the anchor for the search)
p.add_seed_step(db="cas1", name="cas1", e_val=0.001, blast_type="PROT")

# 2. Add filter steps (additional genes to look for near the seed)
p.add_filter_step(db="cas_all", name="cas_all", e_val=0.001, blast_type="PROT")

# 3. Optional: Add specialized steps (e.g., CRISPR arrays)
p.add_crispr_step()

# 4. Run the search on genomic data
# span: how many base pairs to search around the seed
results = p.run(job_id="my_search", data="genome.fna", min_prot_len=90, span=10000)
```

### 2. Operon Analyzer
Once clusters are found, use the Analyzer to apply biological constraints.

```python
from operon_analyzer.analyze import analyze
from operon_analyzer.rules import RuleSet, FilterSet

# Define biological constraints
rs = RuleSet().require('transposase') \
              .exclude('cas3') \
              .at_most_n_bp_from_anything('transposase', 500) \
              .same_orientation()

# Define quality filters
fs = FilterSet().pick_overlapping_features_by_bit_score(0.9) \
                .must_be_within_n_bp_of_anything(1000)

# Execute analysis (typically reads from a results file or stdin)
if __name__ == '__main__':
    analyze(sys.stdin, rs, fs)
```

## Available Analysis Rules
Use these methods within a `RuleSet()` to define valid operon architecture:

*   `require(feature_name)`: Feature must be present.
*   `exclude(feature_name)`: Feature must be absent.
*   `max_distance(feat1, feat2, bp)`: Maximum distance between two specific features.
*   `at_least_n_bp_from_anything(feat, bp)`: Ensures a feature is isolated/not overlapping.
*   `at_most_n_bp_from_anything(feat, bp)`: Ensures a feature is part of a cluster.
*   `same_orientation()`: All features must be on the same strand.
*   `contains_any_set_of_features([[f1, f2], [f3, f4]])`: Logical OR for sets of essential genes.
*   `contains_at_least_n_features(names, count)`: Requires a minimum number of matches from a list.

## Expert Tips
*   **Iterative Refinement**: Start with a broad `span` (e.g., 10,000 bp) in the Gene Finder to ensure you don't miss distant components of a large cluster, then use `max_distance` in the Analyzer to tighten the results.
*   **Bit Score Filtering**: Use `FilterSet().pick_overlapping_features_by_bit_score(0.9)` to handle cases where multiple HMMs or BLAST hits overlap the same ORF, keeping only the highest quality annotation.
*   **Orientation Matters**: For true operons, use `.same_orientation()`. If searching for more complex gene clusters or genomic islands where genes might be on both strands, omit this rule.
*   **Performance**: When running large metagenomic datasets, ensure `num_threads` is set appropriately in `add_seed_step` and `add_filter_step` to utilize available CPU cores.
