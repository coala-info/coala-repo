# gencore

## Overview
gencore is a high-performance bioinformatics tool used for deduplication and error correction in Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) data. Unlike standard deduplicators that simply discard redundant reads, gencore clusters reads derived from the same DNA template to generate a consensus sequence. This process significantly reduces false positives caused by library preparation or sequencing errors. It is particularly effective for cancer genomics and liquid biopsy applications where high-fidelity data is critical.

## Core Usage
The tool requires a sorted BAM/SAM file and a reference genome in FASTA format.

### Basic Consensus Generation
```bash
gencore -i input.sorted.bam -o output.bam -r reference.fasta
```

### Targeted Sequencing (BED file)
To limit processing to specific capturing regions and generate coverage statistics for those regions:
```bash
gencore -i input.sorted.bam -o output.bam -r reference.fasta -b targets.bed
```

### Aggressive Denoising
By default, gencore may output fragments with low support. To increase stringency and only output consensus reads supported by at least 2 reads:
```bash
gencore -i input.sorted.bam -o output.bam -r reference.fasta -s 2
```

## Expert Tips and Best Practices

### UMI Integration
gencore supports Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMIs). For optimal results:
1. Use `fastp` to shift UMIs from the sequence to the read query name before alignment.
2. Ensure the UMI is appended to the read name (e.g., `ReadName_UMI`).
3. gencore will automatically detect and use these UMIs to cluster reads more accurately.

### Understanding Output Tags
The output BAM file contains custom tags that downstream variant callers can utilize:
- `FR`: Forward read number supporting the consensus.
- `RR`: Reverse read number supporting the consensus (present in duplex consensus reads).
- A read with both `FR` and `RR` tags represents a duplex consensus sequence, which is the highest level of error correction.

### Managing Report Size
gencore generates detailed HTML and JSON reports. For very high-coverage data, these files can become large. Use the coverage sampling flag to reduce the report footprint:
```bash
gencore -i input.sorted.bam -o output.bam -r reference.fasta --coverage_sampling=50000
```

### Performance
gencore is written in C++ and is significantly faster with a smaller memory footprint than Java-based alternatives like Picard. It is optimized for paired-end data and handles overlapping regions of pairs by scoring bases based on concordance and quality.
